Rohan: Hey Simran! Long time no see. What's up?
Simran: Hi Rohan! I know, it's been ages. I'm doing great, how about you?
Rohan: Same here, just exploring some offbeat travel destinations in India. Have you been to any unique places lately?
Simran: Oh, that sounds interesting! I actually went to the hidden caves of Meghalaya last month. It was absolutely breathtaking!
Rohan: Wow, Meghalaya! I've heard so much about its beauty. How did you find those hidden caves?
Simran: Well, it took a bit of effort, but the sight of those crystal clear underground rivers and stunning stalagmites made it totally worth it.
Rohan: That sounds amazing. I'm definitely adding Meghalaya to my bucket list. By the way, have you ever been to Ladakh?
Simran: Yes, Ladakh is an absolute paradise! The serene lakes, remote monasteries, and the stunning landscapes make it a traveler's heaven.
Rohan: I've always wanted to visit Ladakh, especially Pangong Tso Lake. Did you get a chance to go there?
Simran: Yes, I did! The color-changing hues of Pangong Tso left me spellbound. It's an experience that can't be put into words.
Rohan: You have definitely fueled my wanderlust even more. Do you have any other offbeat destinations in mind that I should explore?
Simran: Well, have you ever considered visiting the magical hills of Ziro in Arunachal Pradesh? The music festivals and untouched beauty of the place are simply mesmerizing.
Rohan: Ziro sounds fantastic! I've always wanted to attend a music festival amidst nature. Any other hidden gems you'd recommend?
Simran: How about Tirthan Valley in Himachal Pradesh? It's a haven for nature lovers with its unspoiled forests, sparkling rivers, and charming villages.
Rohan: That sounds like my kind of place. I can already imagine the peacefulness of Tirthan Valley. Thanks for sharing these wonderful destinations, Simran.
Simran: Anytime, Rohan! I love discovering new places. It's always exciting to explore the unexplored and create memories that last a lifetime.
Rohan: Absolutely! And it would be even more amazing to explore these hidden gems together someday.
Simran: That sounds like a wonderful idea, Rohan. We could create beautiful memories while exploring these offbeat destinations, just you and me.
Rohan: I couldn't agree more, Simran. I can't wait to embark on these adventures with you, and maybe even discover our own offbeat love story along the way.
Simran: That sounds absolutely perfect, Rohan. Let's make it happen soon!
