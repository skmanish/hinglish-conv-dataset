Aman: Hey Riya, tumne suna hai ki humare college me curfew lagane ka plan hai?
Riya: Haan, suna hai, but mujhe lagta hai bahut unfair hai. Hum toh adults hai, why should we have a curfew?
Aman: Exactly, I mean, we should be given the freedom to make our own decisions and be responsible for them. Curfews treat us like kids.
Riya: Haan yaar, I feel like it's just a way for our parents to control us and not let us explore the world on our own.
Aman: Absolutely, it's like they don't trust us or our judgment. They think we'll get into trouble if we stay out late.
Riya: But Aman, sometimes I do see the benefit of curfews. It keeps us safe and away from potential dangers in the night.
Aman: I get your point, Riya. Safety is important, but by imposing a curfew, they are not really teaching us how to handle ourselves responsibly.
Riya: That's true, but maybe they are just worried about us. Parents always worry about their children.
Aman: I understand, but there has to be a balance between their concern and us having the freedom to explore and learn from our experiences.
Riya: You're right, Aman. It's all about finding that balance. Maybe there can be certain guidelines instead of strict curfews.
Aman: I agree, guidelines will allow us to have some freedom while also ensuring our safety. It's important to have open conversations with our parents about it.
Riya: Absolutely, communication is key. We need to make them understand our perspective while also respecting their concerns.
Aman: Riya, I really admire how you think. You always see both sides of the coin. It's one of the many things I like about you.
Riya:  Thank you, Aman. You're not so bad yourself. I enjoy our discussions and the way you present your arguments.
Aman:  Well, maybe we can continue these discussions over dinner sometime? Let's explore our freedom together.
Riya:  Are you asking me out on a date, Aman?
Aman:  Yes, Riya. I would be honored if you'd join me for dinner. It'll be a chance for us to discuss more topics and understand each other better.
Riya:  I'd love to, Aman. Let's make it happen and see where our debates take us.
