Rohan: Hey Simran, I just discovered this amazing indie artist! You should check them out. 
Simran: Oh really? Tell me more, Rohan. Who is it?
Rohan: Their name is Prateek Kuhad. His latest album is so soothing and perfect for cozy evenings.
Simran: Wow, I've never heard of him. I'll definitely give it a listen. What's your favorite song from his album?
Rohan: I absolutely love "Kasoor." The lyrics are beautiful, and his voice is so captivating.
Simran: I'm excited to listen to it now. Any other indie artists you recommend, Rohan?
Rohan: Yes, there's also Ritviz. His music is a blend of electronic and Indian folk. You'll love his track "Liggi."
Simran: Oh, I've heard of "Liggi" before! It's such a catchy song. Any more recommendations?
Rohan: Absolutely! You should check out Prabh Deep's rap music too. It has a raw and unique vibe. Start with "K. O."
Simran: I'm not usually into rap, but I trust your taste. I'll give it a shot. So, Rohan, how do you always find such amazing artists?
Rohan: Well, I spend a lot of time exploring new music on streaming platforms and social media. 
Simran: That's impressive, Rohan. It's great to have someone who introduces me to new and unheard music.
Rohan: I'm glad you feel that way, Simran. Music is something that really brings us closer, don't you think?
Simran: Absolutely. It's like a language of its own that can connect people on a different level.
Rohan: Do you have any favorite indie artists that you would recommend, Simran?
Simran: Hmm, I really enjoy Dhruv Visvanath's guitar-driven melodies. "Jungle" is one of my favorites.
Rohan: Oh, I've heard of him but haven't had a chance to listen to his music. Thanks for the suggestion, Simran.
Simran: You're welcome, Rohan. I hope you enjoy it as much as I do. 
Rohan: By the way, Simran, what are you doing this weekend? I thought we could go to a music festival together and discover more indie artists.
Simran: That sounds like so much fun, Rohan. I'd love to go with you and explore new music together.
Rohan: Great! I can't wait to share this experience with you, Simran. It's going to be an amazing weekend.
Simran: I'm really excited too, Rohan. Thank you for introducing me to these incredible artists and bringing music into our lives. 
Rohan: No need to thank me, Simran. Sharing music with you is my pleasure. Let's make this weekend the start of something special.
