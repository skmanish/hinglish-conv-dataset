Rohan: Hey Simran! Remember the time we visited Essel World last summer? Such a blast!
Simran: Of course, Rohan! It was one of the most unforgettable experiences ever! I still can't believe we went on all those crazy rides together.
Rohan: Haha, yeah! The roller coasters were insane. I remember how you screamed your lungs out on every twist and turn.
Simran: Oh please, don't remind me! I was so scared, but you were there to hold my hand and calm me down. You were my superhero that day.
Rohan: Well, what can I say? I couldn't let anything happen to my brave Simran. Plus, it gave me the perfect excuse to hold your hand tightly.
Simran: Oh stop it, Mr. Flirty! But I have to admit, it felt nice being close to you. It made the whole experience even more thrilling.
Rohan: You looked absolutely gorgeous that day, Simran. I couldn't take my eyes off you. I still remember how your smile lit up the entire amusement park.
Simran: Aw, thank you, Rohan! You're too sweet. I had so much fun with you that day. It was like a dream come true.
Rohan: You know, Simran, I've been thinking about that day a lot lately. The way your laughter echoed through the air, the way we danced to the music, it felt like we were the only two people in the world.
Simran: I feel the same way, Rohan. That day holds a special place in my heart. It was when I realized how much you mean to me.
Rohan: Simran, you've made me the happiest guy in the world. I can't imagine my life without you. Would you be my girlfriend?
Simran: Rohan, I've been waiting for you to ask me that. Yes, a thousand times, yes! You're the guy who made my amusement park experience turn into a fairytale.
Rohan: Oh, Simran, you've just made me the luckiest man alive! I promise to always be there for you, to create more unforgettable memories together.
Simran: And I promise to cherish every moment with you, Rohan. Let's continue making beautiful memories, and maybe even visit that amusement park again, but this time as a couple.
Rohan: Absolutely, my love. Our journey has just begun, and I can't wait for our happily ever after. I love you, Simran.
Simran: I love you too, Rohan. Forever and always.
