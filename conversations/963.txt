Rohan: Hey, Priya! Tere paas koi interesting festival experience hai?
Priya: Haan, Rohan! Mere paas ek Holi wala incident hai! Jab main college mein thi, hum sab friends ne Holi celebrate kiya tha.
Rohan: Wow, Holi is always fun! Kya hua tha?
Priya: Well, there was this guy who threw yellow color on me, and I retaliated by throwing pink on him! Fir humne ek dusre ko full-on rang bhar diya. It was hilarious!
Rohan: That sounds amazing! Woh definitely lucky tha ki usne tujhe color kiya.
Priya: Haha, sahi kaha! But what about you, Rohan? Koi unique festival moment hai tere paas?
Rohan: Haan, Priya! Mere paas ek Diwali ka incident hai. Mere college friends ke saath maine Diwali kiya tha apne hometown mein.
Priya: Diwali is such a magical festival! Kya hua tha?
Rohan: We were bursting crackers and watching the beautiful fireworks in the sky. And then there was this one sparkler that wouldn't light up for me. Sudha, ek friend, helped me light it up. Usne bilkul Diwali ki raat chamka diya tha.
Priya: How sweet! Festivals definitely bring people closer. Woh Sudha kaafi lucky hai!
Rohan: Haan, woh hai. Lekin Priya, tu ek dum Diwali ki tarah chamakti hai!
Priya:  Oh, stop it, Rohan! Tum bhi kisi ki Diwali ki raat jaise khushiyan le aate ho.
Rohan:  Sach mein? How about we create some more festival-like moments together?
Priya:  Rohan, don't get too cheesy now. Lekin, why not? Festivals mein yehi maza hai, right?
Rohan: Absolutely, Priya! Let's make every day feel like a festival, celebrating our special moments together.
Priya:  I would love that, Rohan. Har din khushiyon ki masti bhari Diwali feel karna.
