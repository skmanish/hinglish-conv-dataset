Raj: Hey, Kavya! Kaisi ho? Long time no see!
Kavya: Hey Raj! Main theek hoon. Tum kaise ho? It has been a while indeed!
Raj: I'm good, yaar. Just missing our fun hangouts. You remember how we used to go street shopping, right?
Kavya: Haan, yaar! Woh din yaad aate hain. Which are your favorite street shopping places in India?
Raj: Delhi mein Sarojini Nagar and Janpath are the best, yaar. They have trendy clothes at reasonable prices.
Kavya: True, but I love the street markets in Mumbai too. Colaba Causeway and Linking Road are my go-to places for fashionable clothes and accessories.
Raj: Oh, so you're a Mumbaikar at heart, huh? But have you been to Commercial Street in Bangalore? It's a paradise for shopaholics!
Kavya: No, I haven't been there yet. But I've heard a lot about it. I heard you get a great deal on traditional wear there, right?
Raj: Absolutely! You'll find everything from ethnic wear to shoes and accessories. Plus, the bargaining skills you learn there are unmatched!
Kavya: Wow, I need to visit Commercial Street soon. By the way, have you been to Fashion Street in Pune?
Raj: Yeah, I have. Fashion Street is bustling with college students looking for trendy clothes at cheap rates. The vibe there is amazing.
Kavya: That sounds fantastic! We should plan a shopping spree together soon.
Raj: I would love that, Kavya. We could explore all these street markets together and find the best deals.
Kavya: It's a date then, Raj. We'll shop till we drop and have the best time ever!
Raj: Can't wait for that day, Kavya! I'm really looking forward to spending more time with you.
Kavya: Me too, Raj! You're such a fun person, and I always enjoy being in your company.
Raj: Thanks, Kavya. It means a lot to me. You're the one who makes everything more enjoyable.
Kavya: You know, Raj, you have a great taste in fashion. I always love your sense of style.
Raj: Aww, thank you, Kavya! That's so sweet of you to say. Coming from you, it makes me feel extra confident.
Kavya: Well, you should be confident because you're quite dashing too, Raj.
Raj: Blushing now, Kavya! But I must say, you look absolutely stunning in whatever you wear.
Kavya: Flirting with me now, are you? Well, I have to admit, it's working.
Raj: Guilty as charged, Kavya. But how about we continue this flirting session over a cup of coffee after our shopping spree?
Kavya: That sounds like the perfect plan, Raj. Count me in!
Raj: Great! So, let's mark our calendars for the most memorable shopping date ever!
Kavya: I can't wait, Raj. I'm really looking forward to it.
