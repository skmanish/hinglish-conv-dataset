Rohan: Hey Sneha! Kaisa hai? Long time no see!
Sneha: Hey Rohan! I'm good, yaar. It has been ages since we caught up. 
Rohan: Bilkul sahi baat, yaar. Life has been so busy lately. By the way, did you hear about the recent elections?
Sneha: Haan, I did. Politics seems to be taking some interesting turns, don't you think?
Rohan: Absolutely! Kuchh naya ho raha hai. It's fascinating to see how the dynamics are changing.
Sneha: True. We are witnessing a shift in alliances and strategies. It keeps us on our toes.
Rohan: Ek minute... politics aside, Sneha, let me tell you something. You are looking stunning today.
Sneha: Thank you, Rohan. But let's focus on politics for now. No distractions!
Rohan: Alright, alright. No distractions, I promise. So, what are your thoughts on the party manifestos?
Sneha: Well, some promises sound too good to be true. We need to analyze the feasibility of their plans.
Rohan: I agree. We need a government that can deliver on its promises and bring about positive change.
Sneha: Exactly! We can't afford to be swayed by empty words. The country needs capable leaders.
Rohan: You're so right, Sneha. By the way, have I ever told you how intelligent and quick-witted you are?
Sneha: Rohan, focus! Remember, no distractions.
Rohan: Okay, okay. No distractions. But seriously, you have a unique way of analyzing things.
Sneha: Haha, thanks Rohan. Now, back to politics. What do you think about the rising influence of regional parties?
Rohan: Regional parties have surely become strong players. They can't be ignored anymore.
Sneha: Absolutely. They are securing their ground and demanding more attention from the national parties.
Rohan: Sneha, I have a question for you. What makes you so passionate about politics? It's impressive!
Sneha: Well, I believe that politics has a direct impact on our lives. We need to be aware and engaged.
Rohan: Your passion is inspiring, Sneha. It's one of the many things I find attractive about you.
Sneha: Rohan, please! We have to discuss politics seriously. No more distractions.
Rohan: Okay, fine. I'll behave. But remember, Sneha, I find everything about you irresistible.
Sneha: Oh god, Rohan! Now you're making it difficult for me to concentrate.
Rohan: Sneha, let's take a small break from politics. I want to tell you something.
Sneha: Fine, one small break. What is it?
Rohan: Sneha, I have liked you for a long time. You're not just smart, but also beautiful. I can't stop thinking about you.
Sneha: Rohan, I... I have feelings for you too. I just didn't know how to express it.
