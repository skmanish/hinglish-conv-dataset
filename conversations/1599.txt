Rohan: Hey Riya! Kaisa hai tu? Long time, no talk!
Riya: Hey Rohan! Haan yaar, I've been really busy with work. Tum kaise ho?
Rohan: Oh, I'm good. Just counting days for the weekend! Tune weekend plans banaye?
Riya: Haan, soch rahi thi, maybe we could go for a movie and dinner.
Rohan: That sounds great! Which movie do you want to watch?
Riya: Mujhe ek romantic movie dekhni hai, with some action too. Koi suggestion?
Rohan: How about 'Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge'? Classic hai, romantic and action-packed!
Riya: Perfect choice, Rohan! DDLJ dekhenge aur phir dinner pe chalenge.
Rohan: Sounds like a plan! Tujhe kya pasand hai, Indian ya Italian cuisine?
Riya: I love Indian food, Rohan! Accha Indian restaurant suggest kar sakte ho?
Rohan: Definitely! Main neha thought, hum tabla pe dinner kar sakte hai. Waha ambiance bhi achi hai.
Riya: Tabla is a great place! Chalo, waha dinner karke full-on enjoy karenge.
Rohan: Haan bilkul! Aur post dinner, kahi coffee shop pe baithte hai, aur aur karte hai?
Riya: Coffee sounds perfect to end the evening. But aur kya kar sakte hai?
Rohan: Maybe we could take a walk by the beach or just sit and talk under the stars?
Riya: That sounds incredibly romantic, Rohan! I would love that.
Rohan: Me too, Riya. Tumhari company mein ekdum khushi feel hoti hai.
Riya: Same here, Rohan. Tumhe paas hone mein mujhe bahut sukoon milta hai.
Rohan: Teri muskurahat mujhe hamesha attract karti hai, Riya.
Riya: Tumhari baatein aur tera pyaar hamesha mere dil ko chhoo jate hai, Rohan.
Rohan: Riya, tumhara saath mere liye bahut important hai. I feel lucky to have you.
Riya: Rohan, tum mere zindagi ka ek anmol hissa ban gaye ho. I'm grateful for you.
Rohan: Ab main aur excited ho gaya hai for our weekend plans! Shayad main tujhse haath pakadunga?
Riya: Definitely, Rohan. Mera haath pakadlo, mujhe tumhare saath woh special connection milta hai.
Rohan: Ab mujhe bas yeh weekend jaldi se aane do, I can't wait to create more beautiful memories with you, Riya.
Riya: Same here, Rohan. This weekend will be the start of something amazing between us. Can't wait to spend more time with you.
