Rajat: Hey, Naina! Have you ever heard about the legend of Mahishasura?
Naina: Oh yes, Rajat! Mahishasura was a powerful demon who was defeated by Goddess Durga.
Rajat: Absolutely! It's fascinating how she emerged from her divine powers to save the world. Do you believe in such legends?
Naina: Well, I find them intriguing. These stories have been passed down through generations, so there must be some truth to them.
Rajat: That's true. Our rich mythology is filled with such enchanting tales. Have you heard about the story of Radha and Krishna?
Naina: Of course! They are the epitome of love. Their divine love story is timeless and teaches us so much about devotion and sacrifice.
Rajat: Indeed, their love was pure and unconditional. It's incredible how their bond is celebrated even today. Do you think we can find a love like theirs?
Naina: Who knows, Rajat? If we believe in love and destiny, anything is possible. Maybe we are destined for a love story of our own.
Rajat: That's an optimistic perspective. I hope our love story will be as magical as those in our folklore. You know, Naina, you are like a real-life princess to me.
Naina: Oh, Rajat! You are such a charmer. Thank you for making me feel special. You are no less than a prince charming to me.
