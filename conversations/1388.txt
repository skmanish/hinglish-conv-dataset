Rohan: Hey, Preeti! It's been ages since we last caught up. How have you been?
Preeti: Hey, Rohan! I've been good. The weather has been so unpredictable lately, hasn't it?
Rohan: Absolutely, Preeti! The weather gods seem to be playing a game with us. One minute it's raining, and the next it's scorching hot!
Preeti: I know, right? It's like mother nature can't make up her mind. And it's making it so difficult for me to plan my outfits!
Rohan: Haha, I feel you! I've been standing in front of my wardrobe for ages, unable to decide what to wear. Crazy weather!
Preeti: Tell me about it! And I just bought this cute umbrella, thinking it would rain every day. But nope! It's just sitting there, unused.
Rohan: Well, if you ever need a reason to use that umbrella, count me in for a walk in the rain. I have always wanted to do that with someone special.
Preeti: Oh, really? Are you asking me out, Mr. Romantic?
Rohan: Maybe I am, Miss Preeti. Who knows? Walking in the rain could be the start of something beautiful.
Preeti: Well, Mr. Romantic, that's quite an idea. Rain always makes everything feel magical. Count me in!
Rohan: Great! I'll even bring my guitar along, serenade you with some romantic tunes. We'll make memories under the rain.
Preeti: Awww, that sounds amazing, Rohan. You really know how to make a girl feel special. Can't wait for that romantic walk!
Rohan: Trust me, Preeti, this walk will be one for the books. It will be a moment we'll cherish forever.
Preeti: I have no doubt about that, Rohan. So, let's hope for some rain soon, and let the magic begin.
Rohan: Absolutely, Preeti! Rain or shine, I'll make sure we have the most wonderful time.
