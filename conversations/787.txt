Riya: Hey Raj, kya haal hai? How's it going?
Raj: Sab thik hai Riya! Just got back from the gym. Tum kaisi ho?
Riya: I'm good too, Raj! Gym kaafi din se nahi gayi thi, kya kar rahi thi tu?
Raj: Well, maine apna gym routine thoda update kiya hai. Let me tell you about my new exercises.
Riya: Haan, mujhe bhi sunao! I'm always looking for new gym ideas.
Raj: So, I started doing deadlifts and squats. Wo bhi heavy weights ke saath!
Riya: Wow, Raj! You're really pushing yourself. Mujhe bhi uska try karna chahiye.
Raj: Definitely, Riya! Tumhara fitness level bhi amazing hai, you'll rock it.
Riya: Thanks, Raj! Tumne weights ke sath cardio kar rahi ho ya separately?
Raj: I prefer doing cardio separately. Usually, I go for a run in the evenings. Mujhe long-distance running bahut pasand hai.
Riya: Same here, Raj! Mujhe bhi running bahut achha lagta hai. Maybe we should go for a run together sometime?
Raj: That sounds like a great idea, Riya! Hum dono ek dusre ko motivate kar sakte hai.
Riya: Absolutely! Aur humari competition bhi ho jayegi, healthy competition, of course.
Raj: Haan, competition toh important hai. It pushes us to do better. Lekin waise, Riya, tu gym jaa rahi hai ya kisi specific reason ke liye?
Riya: Raj, sach bolu toh, mujhe neend nahi aati rahi ghar pe, so gym is a good way to stay active. Aur dusre logon se milna bhi accha lagta hai.
Raj: I understand, Riya. Gym khali body ko workout karne ke liye hi nahi hai, it's also a good way to meet new people. By the way, tumhara favorite exercise kaunsa hai?
Riya: Hmm, difficult question hai! Lekin mujhe push-ups and lunges bahut achhe lagte hai. Core strength ke liye plank bhi karti hu.
Raj: Wow, Riya! Tumhara dedication to fitness commendable hai. Ek baat bolu, tumhara stamina amazing hai!
Riya: Thank you, Raj! Tum bhi koi specific diet follow karte ho gym ke sath?
Raj: Haan, I try to eat clean and incorporate protein-rich foods in my diet. Lekin cheat days bhi important hai, right? Pizza cravings ko mana hi nahi kar paata hu!
Riya: Absolutely, Raj! Cheat days give us that motivation to stick to our routine. I can't resist chocolate on my cheat days!
Raj: Chocolate cravings are hard to resist, Riya. Mujhe bhi kuch khaas tips chahiye apne sweet cravings ko control karne ke liye.
Riya: We can definitely share some tips, Raj! Milke healthy dessert recipes try karte hai and motivate each other.
Raj: That sounds perfect, Riya! Ab toh gym ke sath healthy dessert sessions bhi planned hai. I'm looking forward to it.
Riya: Me too, Raj! It's great when fitness routines bring people closer. Chalo, kal subah gym mein milte hai?
Raj: Pakka, Riya! Ek dusre ko inspire karne ke liye, and maybe after gym, we can grab a healthy breakfast together?
Riya: Raj, that's a great idea! I'm really looking forward to spending more time with you.
Raj: Me too, Riya! Chalo, abhi tak humne kitni baar flirt kiya hai? Ek coffee date pe toh chalenge, right?
Riya: Haha, definitely Raj! Coffee date sounds perfect. Can't wait to see where our fitness journey takes us, and beyond.
Raj: Same here, Riya! Dil mein hai fitness, or maybe even more. Let's make this journey together.
