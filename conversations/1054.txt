Riya: Hey Rohan, have you heard about the legend of the Taj Mahal?
Rohan: Haan, Riya. Taj Mahal ka kahani, toh yeh Dilli ke qareeb hai, right?
Riya: Absolutely! It's in Agra, but it was built by the Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his wife, Mumtaz Mahal.
Rohan: Wah, that's such a beautiful love story! Even the architecture of Taj Mahal is splendid!
Riya: True! It's considered one of the Seven Wonders of the World. But you know, there are more fascinating legends from different parts of India.
Rohan: Really? Tell me more, Riya! I love listening to these folk tales.
Riya: So, have you heard about the legend of King Mahabali and Onam from Kerala?
Rohan: Oh, yes! Mahabalichettan! I've heard it's about the virtuous king and the celebration of Onam in his honor.
Riya: Absolutely, Rohan! The story goes that the king sacrificed everything for his people, and Lord Vishnu granted him the boon to visit his kingdom once a year on Onam.
Rohan: That's fascinating! It's amazing how these legends are still celebrated and cherished till date.
Riya: Absolutely! And there's another legend, the story of Rani Padmini from Chittorgarh in Rajasthan.
Rohan: Oh, Rani Padmini! I've heard she was known for her beauty and courage. Wasn't she involved in a siege with Alauddin Khilji?
Riya: Yes, that's correct! It's believed that her beauty was so enchanting that it led to a battle for her. She chose self-immolation to protect her honor.
Rohan: Wow, Riya! These legends are so intriguing. I wish we could visit these places and witness the history ourselves.
Riya: That would be amazing, Rohan! Exploring the rich cultural tapestry of India together sounds like a dream.
Rohan: Speaking of dreams, Riya, whenever I'm with you, it feels like every moment is a magical legend in itself.
Riya: Rohan, you always know how to make my heart flutter. Your words feel like a beautiful melody from a distant romance.
Rohan: Riya, just like these folk tales, our love story will be written with an epic, everlasting ink. And every moment spent together will be a legend of its own.
Riya: Oh, Rohan! In your arms, I feel like I've stepped into an enchanting fairy tale. Let's create our own magical love story, my prince charming.
Rohan: Riya, you are my queen, and our love will be immortal, just like the legends we cherish. I promise to protect and cherish you always.
Riya: And I vow to love and support you in every chapter of our story, my knight in shining armor. Let's embark on this beautiful journey together, forever.
