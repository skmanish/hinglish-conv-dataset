Rohan: Arey Kavya, did you hear about the latest achievement by ISRO? They successfully launched the Chandrayaan-2 mission to the moon!
Kavya: Wah! Yeh toh bahut exciting hai! I'm so proud of ISRO. India's space missions have come a long way, haven't they?
Rohan: Haan, bilkul! And to think that India even had a mission to Mars, the Mangalyaan! It's incredible how our country is making its mark in space exploration.
Kavya: Sach mein! Our scientists and engineers are truly brilliant. I can't help but feel a sense of pride for our nation.
Rohan: Tumhein pata hai, there are many young Indians who are inspired by ISRO and dream of becoming astronauts or scientists in the future.
Kavya: Really? That's so wonderful! It's great to see the youth being inspired by our space missions. It's a reflection of how much potential our country has.
Rohan: Absolutely, Kavya. Our potential in the field of space exploration is immense. Who knows, we might even have people from India walking on the moon one day!
Kavya: Wow, that would be a historic moment! I hope I get to witness it in my lifetime.
Rohan: Well, who says we can't make our own history, Kavya? We can explore the world together, just like our space missions explore the universe!
Kavya: Haha, you always have a way with words, don't you, Rohan? But I have to say, the idea of exploring the world with you sounds quite intriguing.
Rohan: Ab toh, you have me blushing! But seriously, Kavya, I've always felt a sense of adventure when I think about space missions. It's like exploring the unknown, just like our future together.
Kavya: Future together? Sounds like you have big plans, Rohan. What exactly do you mean?
Rohan: Well, Kavya, I mean that just like ISRO's missions, we can have our own journey filled with discoveries, excitement, and reaching for the stars. I want to explore a future with you, Kavya.
Kavya: Oh, Rohan! That's so sweet of you. It's like our own little space adventure, isn't it? Count me in for this journey, because I can't wait to explore the unknown with you.
Rohan: I'm really glad to hear that, Kavya. You've made me the happiest person in the universe. I promise to make every moment of our journey a memorable one.
Kavya: And I promise to be right beside you, supporting and exploring with you every step of the way, Rohan. This is just the beginning of our beautiful journey together.
Rohan: I couldn't ask for anything more, Kavya. You mean the world to me, and I'm so grateful to have you in my life. I love you.
Kavya: I love you too, Rohan. Let's make our journey together even more amazing than any space mission. You have my heart and my love, forever and always.
