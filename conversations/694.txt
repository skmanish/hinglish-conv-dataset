Rahul: Hey Neha! Kaise ho? Long time no see!
Neha: Hey Rahul! Haan, it's been so long! Main theek hu, tu kaisa hai?
Rahul: Main bhi theek hu, Neha. You know, I was talking to my grandparents yesterday and they were telling me about their childhood during the partition era.
Neha: Really? That must have been so interesting! I love listening to stories from that time.
Rahul: Haan, bilkul! They were sharing how they used to play with their friends, despite the tense situation.
Neha: Wow! That shows the spirit and resilience of that generation. It's incredible how they found joy in the midst of such chaos.
Rahul: Absolutely! They also mentioned how they would visit their ancestral village and celebrate festivals together as one big family.
Neha: That's so heartwarming. It's sad to see how families are often scattered today. We should learn from them and prioritize our relationships.
Rahul: You're right, Neha. We should cherish our loved ones and create memories together while we still can.
Neha: Absolutely, Rahul. By the way, I must say you have a very thoughtful side. It's nice to have conversations like these.
Rahul: Thanks, Neha. I feel comfortable talking to you about anything. You have this way of making conversations so enjoyable.
Neha: That's sweet of you to say, Rahul. You're not so bad yourself!
Rahul: Haha, thanks Neha. You know, I can't help but notice how beautiful your eyes are.
Neha: Oh really? Tum bhi kuch kam nahi ho, Rahul. Your smile can light up a room.
Rahul: You're making me blush, Neha. I love spending time with you. I feel like we have a special connection.
Neha: I feel it too, Rahul. It's like we've known each other for years. I can't help but smile whenever I see a message from you.
Rahul: Neha, I have to say something. I have developed feelings for you. I hope you feel the same way.
Neha: Rahul, I can't lie to you. I have been feeling the same way too. I'm glad you opened up about your feelings.
Rahul: Neha, would you like to go on a date with me? I want to spend more time with you and get to know you better.
Neha: I would love to, Rahul. I can't wait to go on a date with you. I have a feeling it will be amazing.
Rahul: Neha, you've made me the happiest person right now. I can't wait for our date. I promise to make it special.
Neha: I know you will, Rahul. I'm looking forward to our budding romance. Let's make beautiful memories together.
