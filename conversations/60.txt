Asha: Hey, Rohan! Kaise ho? Long time no see!
Rohan: Hey, Asha! Main bilkul theek hoon. Tum kaisi ho? Missed talking to you!
Asha: Main bhi theek hoon! Bade busy ho gaye the hum dono. By the way, have you read any good regional literature lately?
Rohan: Haan, actually, I recently read a beautiful Hindi novel called 'Maila Anchal.' Tumne padha hai kabhi?
Asha: Oh, haan! 'Maila Anchal' kamal ki hai! It flawlessly captures the essence of rural India and the struggles of the common people. Do you know any other similar authors?
Rohan: Haan, Pandey Bechan Sharma 'Ugra' ka kaam bhi bahut badhiya hai! Unhone Hindusthani ke saath Urdu ko bhi badiya tarah istemal kiya hai.
Asha: That sounds amazing! I'll surely check his work out. Tumhare favorite regional language ki literature kaunsi hai?
Rohan: Mera favourite toh Marathi hai! Pu La Deshpande aur V. P. Kale ki kahaniyan mujhe hamesha hasati hain.
Asha: Oh, Marathi literature is brilliant! Pu La Deshpande ke humorous stories aur V. P. Kale ki emotional tales bahut heartwarming hote hain. Tumne Bengali literature kabhi explore kiya hai?
Rohan: Maine toh Bengali literature zara bhi nahi padha. Any recommendations from you?
Asha: Definitely! Satyajit Ray ki 'Feluda' series aur Rabindranath Tagore ki 'Gitanjali' zaroor padho. They are masterpieces in Bengali literature.
Rohan: Amazing! You have quite an extensive knowledge of different regional literatures. I'm impressed!
Asha: Thank you, Rohan! I have always been fascinated by the diverse cultures and languages of our country. So, how about we discuss more literature over a cup of tea sometime?
Rohan: That sounds perfect, Asha! I'd love to spend some quality time with you and delve deeper into these fascinating regional literatures.
Asha: Great! Let's plan it soon then. I can't wait to hear more about your favorite authors and their works.
Rohan: Me too, Asha! I'm really looking forward to our exciting literary rendezvous.
