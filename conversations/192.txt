Rohan: Diwali is just around the corner, Aisha! Have you started preparing for it?
Aisha: Haan Rohan, I've already started cleaning the house and decorating it with beautiful lights!
Rohan: That's great, Aisha! Diwali is always so much more enjoyable when the house is all decked up. By the way, have you thought about what to wear on Diwali night?
Aisha: Oh, I'm still confused, Rohan! I have so many options, but I can't decide which outfit to choose. What about yourself?
Rohan: Well, I'm thinking of wearing a traditional kurta pajama this time. It's always nice to dress up in Indian attire for such festivals, don't you think?
Aisha: Absolutely, Rohan! Indian attire adds a certain charm and elegance to the celebrations. I'm sure you'll look handsome in a kurta pajama!
Rohan: Thank you, Aisha! Your sweet compliments always make my heart skip a beat. So, have you planned any special sweets or snacks for Diwali?
Aisha: Yes, Rohan! I love cooking, and during Diwali, I always prepare a variety of sweets like gulab jamun, jalebi, and some crispy namkeens as well.
Rohan: Woah, Aisha! You never fail to impress me with your culinary skills. I wish I could taste all those delicious treats you make.
Aisha: Well, maybe this Diwali, you'll get a chance to taste them all, Rohan. How about coming over to my place on Diwali day? We can celebrate together.
Rohan: Aisha, that's such a wonderful invitation! I would be delighted to spend Diwali with you. It sounds like a perfect plan.
Aisha: I'm glad you're excited, Rohan. It will be a memorable Diwali celebration, filled with joy, laughter, and of course, lots of love.
Rohan: Aisha, I can't wait for Diwali now. It's going to be a festival of lights and our love, shining brighter than ever.
Aisha: Oh, Rohan! You always have a way with words. Your love fills my heart with warmth and happiness. I'm truly blessed to have you in my life.
Rohan: The feeling is mutual, Aisha. You are my guiding light, my support, and my everything. I can't imagine celebrating Diwali without you by my side.
Aisha: Rohan, you make me feel so special. I'm counting the days until Diwali when we can make beautiful memories together.
Rohan: Aisha, every moment with you is special, but I know this Diwali will be an unforgettable one. I can't wait to create memories that will last a lifetime.
Aisha: I love you, Rohan. Diwali or not, every day spent with you is a celebration of our love.
Rohan: I love you too, Aisha. Let's make this Diwali the most magical one for us.
