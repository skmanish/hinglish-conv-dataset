Riya: Hey Rohan, kya haal hai? Tum kaise ho?
Rohan: Hey Riya, main bilkul theek hoon, thank you! Aur tum? Kaise ho?
Riya: Main bhi achhi hoon, thanks. Tumhari day kaisi rahi?
Rohan: It was good. Lekin aaj maine ek interesting topic par debate kiya, Indian educational boards ke merits par. Tumhare thoughts kya hai?
Riya: Oh, sounds interesting! Main personally CBSE board ko prefer karti hoon. Tum?
Rohan: Interesting! I think I lean towards ICSE board. Mujhe lagta hai wo students ko practical knowledge provide karta hai.
Riya: Haan, I agree. Lekin CBSE mein time management aur syllabus flexibility zyada hai.
Rohan: Yeah, that's true. But ICSE students ko deeper understanding ho jati hai concepts ki.
Riya: Hmmm, sahi hai. Lekin college admissions mein konsa board better hai, wo kya kehna chahoge?
Rohan: Well, mujhe lagta hai CBSE board ka recognition zyada hai colleges mein.
Riya: Hmm, you may be right. Lekin ICSE students ka English grammar aur communication skills zyada strong hote hai.
Rohan: That's true. Dono boards ke apne advantages hai. But in the end, it's all about individual capabilities and skills.
Riya: Absolutely! Humne apna point of view share kiya, lekin kya tu mujhe ek suggestion de sakte hai?
Rohan: Of course, Riya! Anything for you. Kya help chahiye?
Riya: Mujhe apne math subject mein improvement chahiye. Kya tu mujhe guide kar sakte hai?
Rohan: Riya, main hamesha ready hoon tumhari madad karne ke liye. Don't worry, hum saath mein practice karenge.
Riya: Thank you, Rohan! Tu bahut sweet hai. I really appreciate your support.
Rohan: Riya, it's my pleasure to help you. Tumhara saath pa kar accha lagta hai. Kya hum kal library mein mil sakte hai?
Riya: That sounds great, Rohan! I would love that. Kal library mein mileinge aur phir maths solve karenge.
Rohan: Perfect! Milte hai kal library mein. Waha pe aur bhi kuch padhne ke saath-kuch masti bhi karenge.
Riya: Haan, I'm looking forward to it! Thank you again, Rohan. Tumse milne ka wait rahega.
Rohan: The pleasure is all mine, Riya. Mujhe bhi tumse milne ki bhadaas thi. Kal hum masti karenge, samjhe?
Riya: Haha, samjhe! Masti to honi hi chahiye. Chalo, abhi taklif se thora door ho jate hai. Goodnight, Rohan!
Rohan: Goodnight, Riya! Sweet dreams and see you tomorrow.
