Akshay: Hey, Neha! Guess what? I attended an Indian classical music concert last night!
Neha: Wow, that sounds amazing! I've always wanted to experience it. How was it, Akshay? 
Akshay: Neha, it was magical! The atmosphere was so divine, and the music touched my soul. It was an experience like no other.
Neha: I can only imagine. Classical music has a way of transporting you to another world. Which ragas did they perform?
Akshay: They started with Raag Bhairav, Neha. The performance was so mesmerizing; it made my heart skip a beat. The artist exhibited such skill and emotion.
Neha: Oh, I love Raag Bhairav! It has such a calming effect. Did they play any thumris or khayals?
Akshay: Yes, they did. They even performed a beautiful thumri in the Raag Kafi. It was so romantic; it felt like they were singing just for me. It gave me butterflies in my stomach.
Neha: Oh, how romantic! I wish I could have witnessed that. What other ragas did they explore?
Akshay: They also played Raag Yaman, Neha. It was divine! The artist's soulful rendition left everyone spellbound. I got lost in the music; it felt like a dream.
Neha: That must have been an incredible experience, Akshay. I can't wait to attend such a concert myself. 
Akshay: Neha, you should definitely come with me next time. I would love to share this magical experience with you. We could make it a romantic evening under the stars.
Neha: Akshay, that sounds wonderful! I would be delighted to join you. Sharing this beautiful experience with you would make it even more special.
Akshay: Really? I can't wait for that day. We'll have the best time together, Neha. I've always wanted to share something so beautiful with someone special like you.
Neha: Akshay, you're so sweet. I'm looking forward to that beautiful evening under the stars, with you by my side.
