Reeta: Hey Rahul, kya haal hai? Long time, no see! Tum dance class kab se join kiye ho? 
Rahul: Hey Reeta! Haan yaar, it's been a while. Main ek mahine pehle hi join kiya tha dance class, mujhe dancing bahut pasand hai. Tum batao, tumne kya join kiya hai?
Reeta: That's great, Rahul! I recently joined an art class. Mujhe painting aur sketching kaafi pasand hai. Mujhe pehle se hi interest tha, toh finally decide kiya join karne ka.
Rahul: That sounds amazing, Reeta! Art is such a beautiful way of expressing oneself. Tumne kya kya learn kiya hai ab tak? 
Reeta: Well, I've learned different techniques of shading and mixing colors. Abhi tak landscape aur still life sketched kiye hai. Tum dance class me kya sikha rhe ho? 
Rahul: Mainly contemporary dance aur hip-hop sikh rha hu. It's a great stress buster. Kabhi kabhi evening me ghar jaake headphones laga ke bas dance kar leta hu. Mujhe sirf steps nahi, emotions express karne ka bhi maza aata hai.
Reeta: Wow, Rahul! Tumhe toh dance me passion hai. Kabhi mujhe bhi dance sikhado na!
Rahul: Zaroor, Reeta! Main tumhe zarur dance steps teach karunga. But in return, mujhe ek painting banake dedo, haan? Tumhaari art skills mujhe bahut acchi lagti hai.
Reeta: Deal, Rahul! Ek painting banake zarur karungi. Lekin tab tak dance steps ke saath saath music bhi teach karna. Tumhara favorite song kaunsa hai jo dance karne me jyada masti aati hai?
Rahul: Oh, mujhe Bollywood songs pasand hai. Especially romantic numbers, jaise "Tum Hi Ho". Woh mujhe hamesha energy deti hai. Tumhaara favorite song kaunsa hai?
Reeta: Mujhe bhi Bollywood music acchi lagti hai. Lately, I've been loving "Ghungroo" from the movie War. Dance karne ka rhythm usme bahut catchy hai. 
Rahul: Achha hai, tumhaare song pe hum dono dance karenge, what do you say? Waise bhi, tumhe dance ka next step bhi sikhana hai mujhe. 
Reeta: Sounds like a plan, Rahul! Dance karke aur paintings banake, hum ek dusre ke interests ko explore karenge. I'm looking forward to our dance and art sessions together.
Rahul: Me too, Reeta! Yeh saath mein hoga, toh aur bhi maza ayega. You've got a beautiful way of expressing yourself through art, and I can't wait to see your dance moves. 
Reeta: Thank you, Rahul. Tumne mujhe inspire kiya, aur saath mein is journey ko enjoy karenge. It's going to be an amazing experience sharing our passions together.
