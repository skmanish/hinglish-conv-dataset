Riya: Hey, Aditya! Tumne suna? The latest diet trend is all about intermittent fasting. Agar weight loss karna hai toh yeh ek game-changer hai, bro!
Aditya: Haan, Riya! I've been hearing a lot about it lately. Par mujhe toh samajh nahi aata ki kaise kisi ka pet itna time khali reh sakta hai. Mujhe toh har do ghante mein kuch na kuch khaana padta hai!
Riya: Haha! Aditya, don't worry. Intermittent fasting mein time restricted hota hai, jaise ki 16 hours fasting aur 8 hours eating window. Tum subah se leke shaam tak fasting kar sakte ho aur raat ko healthy khana kha sakte ho.
Aditya: 16 ghante fasting! Yeh toh bada difficult hai, yaar. Mere bas ki baat nahi!
Riya: Oh, come on! Tum toh gym jaate ho, right? With intermittent fasting, fat burning process boost hoti hai. Aur waise bhi, you look amazing already!
Aditya: Thanks, Riya! Tum bhi quite fit ho. What's your gym routine like?
Riya: Well, I usually start with cardio exercises like jogging or cycling to warm up. Phir main weights aur strength training karte hoon. And, I always make sure to stretch and cool down at the end.
Aditya: That sounds perfect! I think I'll join you for a workout sometime. We can motivate each other, hai na?
Riya: Definitely, Aditya! I would love that. Tum bhi meri inspiration ho after all.
Aditya: Accha? Tumhari motivation toh mujhe bhi inspire karti hai, Riya. Tumhari dedication and fitness level dekhkar mera determination aur strong ho jaata hai.
Riya: Aww, Aditya! You know how to make a girl feel special. Tum bhi bahut sweet ho.
Aditya: Thanks, Riya! Tum bhi bahut cute ho. Waise, tumhare paas koi aur tips hai staying fit ke liye?
Riya: Haan, I have another tip. Along with the diet and gym routine, sleep is crucial for fitness. Proper rest and sleep help in muscle recovery aur overall health.
Aditya: Absolutely right, Riya! Tumhein saara fitness gyaan hai, and I'm lucky to have a friend like you.
Riya: Aww, Aditya! Tum mere best friend ho and I'm lucky to have you too.
Aditya: Best friend? Riya, I want to be more than just friends. Tumhein mere saath ek romantic dinner par chalna hai?
Riya: Aditya, I've been waiting for you to say that. Of course, I would love to go on a romantic dinner with you!
Aditya: That's great, Riya! I can't wait to spend a beautiful evening with you. I'm excited already.
Riya: Me too, Aditya! We're going to have an amazing time together.
