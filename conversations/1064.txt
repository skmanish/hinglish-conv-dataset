Rohan: Hey, Pooja! Kya haal hai? You know, I've been thinking a lot about the changing dynamics in Indian politics lately.
Pooja: Hey Rohan, main bhi bilkul theek hoon! It's interesting how everything is shifting, isn't it? Aajkal kaunsi party tujhe zyada pasand hai? 
Rohan: Well, honestly, I used to support the Congress party, but now I'm leaning towards the Bharatiya Janata Party. Tere views kya hai politics ke upar?
Pooja: Oh really? I have always been more inclined towards Aam Aadmi Party. I just feel ki unka approach youth ke liye sahi hai. By the way, tu toh politics ke baare mein expert hai. Kya reasons hai teri views ke peeche?
Rohan: Haan, one of the main reasons is their focus on economic development. The policies they have implemented have shown positive results in many sectors. Also, unka strong stance against terrorism impressed me. Tu kyun AAP ko support karti hai?
Pooja: Main AAP ko support karti hoon because I believe in their transparency and anti-corruption agenda. Unka youth-centric approach mujhe acha lagta hai. Andar se ek change lane ki koshish hai. Aur tu toh politics ke saath-saath sports mein bhi kaafi passionate hai, isn't it?
Rohan: Haan, bilkul! Politics and sports meri life ke important parts hai. Sports se humara desh bahut talent nikalta hai. Politics should also support and promote sports at grassroots levels. Tu kaunsi sports follow karti hai?
Pooja: I am a big fan of cricket! Virat Kohli ka batting style dekh ke dil khush ho jata hai. But, I also follow kabaddi and hockey tournaments. Humare hockey players bhi international level par kamal kar rahe hai. Tujhe kis sport mein interest hai?
Rohan: Cricket is my favorite too! Virat Kohli is a true inspiration. Apart from that, I enjoy watching kabaddi matches as well. India ka kabaddi team toh duniya mein sabse strong hai. By the way, tujhe politics se real-life impact kya lagta hai?
Pooja: True, kabaddi mein hum unbeatable hai! Politics ka impact life pe bahut hota hai, whether it's economic policies, education system, or social reforms. Humare decisions hamari zindagiyon par directly asar karte hai. Lekin ek baar zaroor ho sakte hai itne serious convos se bor ho gaye hai, kuch light-hearted topic pe chale?
Rohan: Absolutely, humara discussion interesting tha, but ab light mood mein move karte hai. Koi movie dekhne ka plan hai aaj? Dinner ke baad kahi chalna ho toh bolna!
Pooja: Haan, bahut time ho gaya mujhe koi movie dekhi nahi hai. Dinner ke baad mujhe achi Rom-Com movies pasand hai. Tu decide kar le, I'm up for it. By the way, ye sudden plan kis baat pe aaya?
Rohan: Haha, I thought it's a nice way to end our conversation. I wanted to spend some quality time with you, aur movie would be the perfect excuse. So, dinner ke baad tujhe pick up kar lun ya milte hain directly?
Pooja: Chalo, that sounds great! Tujhe pick up karne ki zaroorat nahi, directly mil lete hai. Excited for our movie date! ðŸ˜Š
Rohan: Amazing! I'm looking forward to it too. Milte hain dinner ke baad, and let's continue our discussions about Indian politics in a more fun way. ðŸ˜‰
