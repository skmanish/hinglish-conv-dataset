Raj: Hey Neha, did you attend Rahul's wedding last week?
Neha: Yes, Raj, I was there! It was such a grand event!
Raj: Absolutely! The decorations were beautiful and the food was mouth-watering.
Neha: I know, right? I couldn't resist trying every dish on the menu.
Raj: Haha, you and your love for food! But I can't blame you, everything was so delicious.
Neha: Speaking of delicious, did you notice how stunning Rahul and Priya looked together?
Raj: Oh, definitely! They made such a perfect couple. It was like a fairytale wedding.
Neha: I agree. I couldn't take my eyes off them. They were glowing with happiness.
Raj: They truly deserved all the happiness. They have been together for so long.
Neha: True, their love story is quite inspiring. It gives hope to even the cynics like us.
Raj: Haha, I wouldn't call us cynics, Neha. We just know what we want, right?
Neha: I guess you're right, Raj. We have our own ways of looking at love and relationships.
Raj: Definitely. But seeing Rahul and Priya made me wonder about our own future, you know?
Neha: What do you mean, Raj? Are you trying to say something?
Raj: Well, Neha, I just can't stop thinking about the possibility of us being together one day.
Neha: Raj, you never fail to surprise me. Are you saying we have a chance?
Raj: Yes, Neha. I think we have a special connection. Something worth exploring.
Neha: I've always thought so too, Raj. You make me feel special when we're together.
Raj: Neha, you make me the happiest person. I can't imagine my life without you anymore.
Neha: Raj, you know exactly what to say to sweep a girl off her feet.
Raj: Well, Neha, I can't resist the opportunity to get closer to you. You're irresistible.
Neha: Raj, you're such a charmer. I guess we're both feeling the same way, aren't we?
Raj: Absolutely, Neha. Let's give ourselves a chance and see where this beautiful journey takes us.
Neha: I'd love nothing more, Raj. Let's create our own fairytale, just like Rahul and Priya.
