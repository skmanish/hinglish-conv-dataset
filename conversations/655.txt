Rahul: Hi Priya! Kaisi ho? Long time no chat. 
Priya: Hey Rahul! Haan, bilkul, it's been ages since we talked. I'm good, thanks. Tum kaise ho?
Rahul: Main bhi theek hoon, yaar. Aaj kal busy ho gaya tha. So, Priya, I wanted to ask you, who's your favorite Indian author?
Priya: Oh, mein toh Chetan Bhagat ki books ka bahut fan hoon. His writing is so relatable and enjoyable. Tum kaunsa Indian author prefer karte ho?
Rahul: Well, mein toh Amish Tripathi ki books ko pasand karta hoon. The way he blends mythology and modern storytelling is amazing. Have you read any of his books?
Priya: Haan, actually, I've read a few of his books. They are quite intriguing. His writing style is indeed unique. Which of his books do you like the most?
Rahul: Personally, I loved the Shiva Trilogy series. It's captivating and keeps you hooked till the end. The characters and the storyline are very well-crafted. Have you read that series?
Priya: Oh yes, I've read all three books of the Shiva Trilogy. They were absolutely amazing! The character of Shiva is so captivating and I couldn't put the books down. By the way, Rahul, are you a romantic book person, too?
Rahul: Well, I do enjoy reading romantic novels sometimes. Especially, I'm a big fan of Ravinder Singh's books. The way he portrays love and emotions in his stories is heart-touching. What about you, Priya?
Priya: Haha, I must admit, I'm a sucker for romance too. Durjoy Datta's books are my guilty pleasure. His stories have a unique innocence and simplicity that I find really appealing. You know, Rahul, talking to you about books is so much fun!
Rahul: Haan, Priya, mujhe bhi acha lag raha hai. It's refreshing to have such a lovely conversation with someone who shares similar interests. You are a great person to talk to.
Priya: Thank you, Rahul! I feel the same way. It's nice to connect with you on a deeper level. Do you have any more book recommendations for me?
Rahul: Well, have you ever tried reading Arundhati Roy's "The God of Small Things?" It's a beautiful piece of literature that explores love and loss. I think you'd appreciate it.
Priya: Oh, I've heard a lot about that book, but I haven't read it yet. Thanks for the recommendation, Rahul. I'll definitely add it to my reading list. By the way, it's getting quite late now, isn't it?
Rahul: Haan, it's getting late. But before we go, Priya, can I say something? You are an amazing person, and I've really enjoyed chatting with you. I feel a connection with you that goes beyond books. Would you like to meet up sometime, maybe for a cup of coffee?
Priya: Rahul, I feel the same way. Your company has made me really happy today. I would love to meet you and spend more time together. Coffee sounds perfect. Let's make a plan soon. You've made my day, Rahul.
Rahul: That's wonderful to hear, Priya! We'll make it happen for sure. Thank you for being so open and for accepting my invitation. See you soon, take care.
Priya: Take care too, Rahul. Excited for our coffee date. Bye for now!
Rahul: Bye, Priya. Looking forward to it. Have a great day!
