Rahul: Hey, Pooja! Kaisi ho? Summer holidays aa rahe hain, kuch plans hai?
Pooja: Hey Rahul! Main bilkul theek hoon. Haan, mujhe bahut saare plans hain iss summer break ke liye. Tumhara kya scene hai?
Rahul: Mere bhi khayalon mein bohot saare mast ideas hain. Pehle toh main Goa jaa raha hoon, phir Mumbai aur fir mountains pe trekking. Aur tum?
Pooja: Wow, sounds amazing Rahul! Main bhi Goa jaaungi aur phir ek road trip lekar Jaipur aur Udaipur explore karungi. Adventure ke sath sath, photography bhi karungi. 
Rahul: Ohh, I didn't know you're into photography. That's so cool, Pooja! Maybe we can plan a photo walk together sometime?
Pooja: Haan, bilkul! That sounds like so much fun, Rahul. We can capture some beautiful memories while exploring new places.
Rahul: Exactly! Aur tumhare aur koi specific plans hai? Koi place you always wanted to visit ya kuch different try karna hai?
Pooja: Hmm, actually main ek art workshop join karne ka soch rahi hu. I've always been interested in painting and sketching, so why not enhance my skills during the break?
Rahul: That's really great, Pooja! Tumhara passion hi hai art ka, aur ab ek workshop se usmein improvement bhi hoga. I'm impressed!
Pooja: Thank you, Rahul! Tumhara kisi specific hobby ya passion ke liye koi plans hai?
Rahul: Well, I've always wanted to learn how to play the guitar. So, I'm planning to take some guitar lessons this summer. Mujhe bhi apne skills ko improve karna hai.
Pooja: That's so cool, Rahul! Music is such a beautiful way to express yourself. I'm sure you'll rock it. Maybe once you're a pro, you can serenade me with a romantic song?
Rahul: Haha, definitely Pooja! Tumhare liye guitar bajana toh must hai. Agar tum promise karogi ki mere har concert pe front row mein hogi, toh main ek superstar ban jaunga!
Pooja: Haha, definitely Rahul! Promise, you'll have the biggest fan cheering for you. Lekin tumhe bhi mujhe dance sikhana padega. Haina fair deal?
Rahul: Absolutely, Pooja! I'll teach you all the coolest dance moves. Ek doosre mein kaafi talent hai, you know.
Pooja: Haha, sahi kaha. Yeh summer break humare talents ko explore karne ka ek perfect mauka hai. I'm really looking forward to spending some amazing time with you, Rahul.
Rahul: Same here, Pooja! I can't wait for all the adventures, laughter, and maybe, just maybe, some sweet romantic moments too.
