Rohit: Hey Riya, long time no see! How about we catch up on our shared cab ride from last week?
Riya: Hey Rohit, yeah, that was quite an interesting ride. So, what do you remember about it?
Rohit: Well, first of all, I remember getting stuck in traffic for what felt like hours! It was so frustrating, but luckily, I had good company.
Riya: Haha, true! I was glad we had each other to chat with. Otherwise, it would have been really boring.
Rohit: Absolutely! And do you remember that crazy driver who thought he was in a Formula 1 race? I swear my heart skipped a beat!
Riya: Oh my God, yes! I thought we were going to crash into something any moment. Thank goodness we reached safely.
Rohit: Yeah, definitely. But you know, I have to admit, it was kind of thrilling too, holding onto you for dear life.
Riya:  I must admit, it felt nice to have your arm around me. It made me feel safe even in such a crazy situation.
Rohit: Well, I'll always be there to protect you, Riya. Whether it's from crazy cab rides or anything else.
Riya: That's really sweet of you, Rohit. And I have to say, your sense of humor helped lighten the mood during that ride too.
Rohit: Aw, thanks! I'm glad I could make you smile. It's always a pleasure to be around you and hear your laughter.
Riya: You have a way with words, Rohit. You know, I was actually a little disappointed when we reached our destination.
Rohit: Oh really? Why is that, Riya?
Riya: Well, I was enjoying our time together in the cab so much that I didn't want it to end. It felt like our own little adventure.
Rohit: I feel the same way, Riya. Being with you always feels like an adventure, no matter where we are.
Riya: You always know how to make me blush, Rohit. You're such a charmer.
Rohit: Only because you bring out the best in me, Riya. You make me want to be a better person, and I'm grateful for that.
Riya: That's really sweet of you to say, Rohit. It means a lot to me.
Rohit: Riya, being with you makes me realize how amazing life can be. And I was wondering if... well, if you'd like to be more than just friends.
Riya:  Rohit, I've been waiting for you to say that. I'd love to be more than just friends. You make me really happy.
Rohit:  You make me happy too, Riya. I can't wait to see where our adventures together will take us.
Riya: Me neither, Rohit. Let's make every ride, both in cabs and in life, a memorable one, filled with love and laughter.
Rohit: Absolutely, Riya. Our journey together starts now, and I promise to make every moment unforgettable. I'm so lucky to have you.
Riya: And I'm lucky to have you too, Rohit. Let's create our own happily ever after. I can't wait to see where this new chapter takes us.
Rohit: Me neither, Riya. Here's to new beginnings and an extraordinary love story. I can't wait to write it with you.
