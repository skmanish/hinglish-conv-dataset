Rohan: Hey Simran, have you heard about the latest teen skincare routines and beauty hacks? They say it's a game-changer!
Simran: Oh, yes! I've been diving into all the beauty secrets lately. Let's share what we know, Rohan!
Rohan: Definitely! So, have you tried the double cleansing method? It works wonders for a clear complexion!
Simran: Yes, I have! It's amazing how it removes all the dirt and oil from our face. By the way, have you heard about the 10-step Korean skincare routine?
Rohan: Of course, I have! It seems a bit extensive, but if it gives my skin that youthful glow, I'm all in! What's your favorite step from that routine?
Simran: I love the sheet masks! They give an instant hydration boost and make my skin feel so rejuvenated. Plus, they are so much fun to use!
Rohan: Absolutely! I've seen people use those snail mucin-based creams. They sound weird but seem to have great results. Have you tried any unusual products like that?
Simran: Oh, yes! I've tried a few unconventional things, like using rice water as a toner. It's supposed to give a natural brightness to the skin. What about you, Rohan?
Rohan: Yeah, I've tried using green tea as a facial mist. It's refreshing and helps reduce redness. By the way, do you believe in natural remedies, like turmeric face masks?
Simran: Definitely! I think they're great for brightening the skin. But we should be careful with turmeric stains, especially if we plan on going out afterward! 
Rohan: True! We don't want a yellowish face! So, Simran, which skincare hack has been the most effective for you?
Simran: Hmm, I think using aloe vera gel as an overnight face mask. It's super soothing and makes my skin soft and supple. What about you, Rohan?
Rohan: For me, the ice-cube facial massage has been a game-changer. It tightens my skin and makes me feel fresh in no time. Hey, Simran, since we're talking about beauty, you look stunning today!
Simran: Aw, thank you, Rohan! You're looking quite handsome as well! Hey, have you ever thought about starting a beauty vlog on YouTube to share all these amazing tips?
Rohan: That's a great idea, Simran! I love talking to you about all these things. You inspire me a lot. You know, I can't help but be fascinated by your beauty, inside and out.
Simran: Really, Rohan? That means a lot to me. I can't help but feel a special connection with you too. You bring so much joy into my life.
