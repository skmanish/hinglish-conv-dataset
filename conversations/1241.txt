Rohan: Hey, Shreya! Kaisi ho? How are you settling into the new school?
Shreya: Hey, Rohan! Thoda overwhelming hai yaar. Everything is so new and different. Tumhare liye kaisa tha?
Rohan: Haan, initially even I felt overwhelmed. Par slowly, sab theek ho gaya. You'll adjust soon, don't worry.
Shreya: I hope so. New friends banana is not easy, you know.
Rohan: Absolutely! But trust me, once you find your gang, everything becomes more fun. Woh bhi roz naye logon ko milte rehna padega.
Shreya: Hmm, woh toh pata hai. Par abhi toh sab strangers lagte hai. Koi advice do na?
Rohan: Well, sabse pehle khud ko comfortable feel karne ki koshish karo. Participate in extracurricular activities or join clubs where you share common interests. Wahan se dosti aur baaki sab khud-ba-khud ho jayega.
Shreya: That's a good idea, Rohan. I'll give it a try. Aur tujhe wahan kaise friends mil gaye?
Rohan: Oh, mere case mein ek banda tha, usne hi mujhe apne doston se introduce kiya. Aur phir, we started hanging out regularly and became good friends.
Shreya: That's nice. Achha, aur city ki baat karein? How do you like it?
Rohan: Well, I have to admit, it was a bit difficult at first. Par gradually, ghar jaisa feel hone laga. The city has its own charm and once you start exploring and making memories, you'll love it too.
Shreya: I suppose so. Sab apne time pe ho jayega. Anyway, thanks for the pep talk, Rohan. It helped.
Rohan: Anytime, Shreya! Tumhe masala chai peena pasand hai?
Shreya: Haan, bilkul! Why do you ask?
Rohan: How about we meet at this cute little tea stall near our school tomorrow? We can chat more and maybe explore the city together.
Shreya: That sounds interesting! I'd love to join you. What time should we meet?
Rohan: Let's say 4 pm? Is that okay?
Shreya: Perfect! I'll be there. Looking forward to it.
Rohan: Great! I'll see you then. Have a great day, Shreya!
Shreya: You too, Rohan. Until tomorrow!
