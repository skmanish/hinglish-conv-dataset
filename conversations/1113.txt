Riya: Hey Aman, whatâ€™s up? Did you catch the new TV show last night?
Aman: Haan, Riya! I watched it. You won't believe how dramatic it was!
Riya: Seriously? I love the drama in Indian shows. But sometimes it gets a bit too much, don't you think?
Aman: Yeah, I agree. The exaggerated emotions make it entertaining, but it's kind of unrealistic.
Riya: Absolutely! I miss the good old days of Indian television when the shows were more relatable and had a meaningful message.
Aman: Oh, like those family dramas that taught us the importance of relationships and values?
Riya: Yes! Those shows had such strong characters and storylines that resonated with everyone.
Aman: True, Riya. But now it feels like TV shows have shifted their focus to attracting more viewers with unnecessary glamour and sensationalism.
Riya: Exactly! It seems like they prioritize TRP ratings over quality content.
Aman: Sometimes, I wish we could go back to the simplicity and innocence of those old shows.
Riya: Me too, Aman. The charm of those classics is unparalleled.
Aman: But hey, there are still a few good shows that manage to strike a balance, right?
Riya: Yes, there are some gems that explore meaningful subjects and capture the essence of our society.
Aman: That's true, Riya. We can't overlook those shows that contribute positively to our television industry.
Riya: Absolutely! We need more of such shows that inspire and educate.
Aman: By the way, Riya, you're so passionate about Indian television. I find that incredibly attractive.
Riya: Aww, thank you, Aman! You know, you have a way with words too. I'm glad we can have such interesting conversations.
Aman: Riya, spending time with you is always amazing. You're not just beautiful, but also intelligent and fun to be around.
Riya: Aman, that's so sweet of you to say. I enjoy our conversations too. They make me feel special.
Aman: Riya, you are special. I've been wanting to tell you something for a while now.
Riya: What is it, Aman?
Aman: I have developed strong feelings for you, Riya. Every time we talk, I find myself falling deeper in love with you.
Riya: Aman, I feel the same way. Your presence in my life brings me joy and happiness. I can't imagine my days without you.
Aman: Riya, will you be my girlfriend and allow me to be the guy who makes you smile every day?
Riya: Aman, a million times yes! I'd be so lucky to have you as my boyfriend. You already make me smile all the time.
Aman: Come here, you beautiful girl.
