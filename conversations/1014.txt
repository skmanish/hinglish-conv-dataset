Aryan: Hey, Riya! Kaisi ho? Long time no see! Tumne kuch concerts ya music festivals attend kiye?
Riya: Hey Aryan! Haan, maine kuch festivals attend kiye hain. Last month mere ek friend ke saath Sunburn festival gayi thi. It was an amazing experience!
Aryan: Wow, lucky you! Sunburn is one of the biggest music festivals in India. Kaisa tha? Which artists performed?
Riya: Haan, it was so much fun! Artists like Martin Garrix, DJ Snake, and KSHMR performed. The music was so energetic, and the crowd was crazy!
Aryan: That sounds fantastic! I've always wanted to attend Sunburn. Agli baar mujhe bhi le chalo, please!
Riya: Sure, why not? It would be great to enjoy such events with friends. Tum bhi music festivals pasand karte ho?
Aryan: Definitely! I love the energy at these live shows. Pichle saal main Coldplay ka concert attend kiya tha, and it was mind-blowing. Chris Martin's voice live is just magical!
Riya: Oh wow! I'm so jealous. I'm a huge Coldplay fan. Tumne unka saath Photos hilaye?!
Aryan: Haan, bilkul! Unki concert mein mujhe photo mil gayi, and I also got a chance to shake hands with Chris Martin. Unforgettable moment tha!
Riya: OMG! You're so lucky, Aryan! I hope one day I get a chance to meet my favorite artists too. Kisi aur concert ka plan hai tumhara?
Aryan: Well, actually Vh1 Supersonic festival is happening next month. Main soch raha tha ki wahan jaayein. Tum bhi aaogi?
Riya: Sounds exciting! I would love to join you. Let's make it a date, Aryan. Humne ek dusre ke baare mein bahut kuch miss kiya hai!
Aryan: Absolutely! It's a date, Riya. Maza aayega, hamari favorite music together. Ek romantic concert evening hone wali hai!
Riya: I'm really looking forward to it, Aryan. Ab isse jyada cheesy nahi ho sakti thi hamari conversation!
Aryan: Haha, sahi kaha! Magar sometimes cheesy moments are the best. Waise, tujhe ye kab se pata hai ki mujhe concerts kitna pasand hai?
Riya: Well, I've been observing you for a while now, Aryan. Tere music playlists aur excitement dekhkar pata chala. Tum iss subject pe passionate lagte ho.
Aryan: Oh really? You've been paying attention to me, huh? Ab kya kahu main? Honestly, tujhe dekhkar mujhe koi bhi subject pasand ho jata hai!
Riya: Awww, that's so sweet of you, Aryan. Tum bhi mere dil ke bahut kareeb ho.
Aryan: Dil ke kareeb hona toh theek hai, ab real life mein bhi hum kareeb AA jayein, Riya.
Riya: Ek concert ke baad, Shayad hum kuch aur closer ho sakte hain, Aryan.
Aryan: Absolutely, Riya. I can't wait for that concert to happen! Tera intezar karte karte main thak gaya hu.
Riya: Don't worry, Aryan. We'll make it special. Just eagerly waiting for that romantic concert evening with you!
Aryan: Same here, Riya. Let's make beautiful memories together at that concert. Abhi se excited hone lag gaya hu!
