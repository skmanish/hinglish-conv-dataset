Riya: Yaar, Shilpa! Tu school ke fest mei participate kar rahi hai na?
Shilpa: Haan Riya, I am thinking of joining the dance competition. It's going to be so much fun!
Riya: Wow, that's amazing! Dance is your forte. Tera performance toh hit hoga hi.
Shilpa: Thanks, Riya! Waise, tu bhi kuch plan kar rahi ho?
Riya: Haan, I was thinking of helping in the event management team. I love organizing stuff. Aur tujhe pata hai, Rishabh bhi waha participate karne wala hai?
Shilpa: Rishabh? That cute guy from our chemistry class? Kitna talented hai woh. I am sure he will rock the stage!
Riya: Exactly! I was hoping to spend more time with him during the fest. Kya plan hai aaj shaam ka?
Shilpa: Chal, milte hai cafeteria mein. Waha planning kar sakte hai aur surprise birthday gift bhi dena hai tujhe.
Riya: Aww, you remembered! You are the best, Shilpa!
Shilpa: Of course, yaar! Tere bina humari dosti bhi adhuri hai. Abhi toh mujhe tere liye dance practice bhi karni hai.
Riya: Haha, tu bhi na. Waise, kya socha hai for the fest?
Shilpa: Soch rahi hoon... Dekho, humein bohot ideas hai. Let's organize a fashion show!
Riya: Great idea, Shilpa! We can showcase different traditional outfits from different states. It will be a hit!
Shilpa: Haan, and we can ask Rishabh to be the showstopper. Imagine how charming he will look in a sherwani!
Riya: That's a fantastic idea, Shilpa! I am sure everyone will be waiting to see him. Tere dimaag ki batti jala di tune!
Shilpa: Haha, thanks yaar. Humlog saath mein plan karenge, and make this fest the best one ever.
Riya: Absolutely, Shilpa! And who knows, yeh fest humari dosti ko aur bhi kareeb laayega.
Shilpa: That would be wonderful, Riya. Tu aur Rishabh, and hum saath-saath fest ki excitement experience karenge.
Riya: Soch le, yaar! Agar dream wala dance partner mil gaya toh woh stage pe apni chemistry dikha denge.
Shilpa: Riya, tu bhi na! Abhi se chemistry ke formulas laga rahi hai humare pyaar ki baat. But I hope it becomes true.
Riya: Kahi na kahi, school fest hi yeh magic create kar sakta hai. I am keeping my fingers crossed!
Shilpa: Mere bhi, yaar. Chal, abhi woh gift select karte hai, tere surprise birthday ke liye.
Riya: Tu hamesha mere chehre pe muskurahat bikher deti hai, Shilpa. Thank you for being the best friend anyone could have.
Shilpa: Riya, yeh dosti teri muskurahat ke bina adhoori hai. Tere liye kuch bhi kar sakti hoon. You mean the world to me.
