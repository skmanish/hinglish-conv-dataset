Vikram: Hey Riya, did you attend Rohit's wedding last week? It was such a grand affair!
Riya: Haan, Vikram! Main gayi thi, shaadi ki shubhkamnayein di. The decorations were so beautiful and the food was delicious too!
Vikram: Absolutely! Sab itna shaandaar tha. But tell me, did you notice how stunning the bride looked? She was like a princess!
Riya: Oh, bilkul! Uski lehenga ka design was out of this world. Ekdum elegant!
Vikram: Aur groom toh bhi bilkul princely dikh raha tha. They were the perfect couple, don't you think?
Riya: True, Vikram! They looked made for each other. Sapne sajane wala jodi! I wish them a lifetime of happiness together.
Vikram: Me too, Riya. Shaadiyon mein pyaar aur khushiyan hote hai na, it just feels so magical! We should have our dream wedding like that someday, right?
Riya: Haan, bilkul! Ek perfect wedding, music, dance, masti, aur sabse important, tumhare saath. That would be a dream come true for me.
Vikram: Riya, you know you're special, right? Tumhari muskurahat aur tareefon se dil garden garden ho jaata hai.
Riya: Vikram, tum bhi kuch kam nahi. Tumhare saath waqt bitana, har pal special bana deta hai. Tum mujhe khush-purva mehsoos karte ho.
Vikram: Riya, yeh dil toh bas tumse hi kehta hai ki main tumse bahut pyaar karta hoon. Tum meri zindagi ho.
Riya: Vikram, yeh baat mujhe pehle se pata thi. Tumhare pyaar ki khushboo mujhe hamesha mehsoos hoti hai. Tum mere sapno ka rajkumar ho.
Vikram: Riya, tumne mere tumse pyaar ko samjha, aur ab main sirf tumhara hoon. Tumne dil jeet liya hai.
Riya: Vikram, tumhare saath pyaar mein khona chahti hoon, har lamha sath rehna chahti hoon. Tum mere liye sab kuch ho.
Vikram: Riya, yeh din humare pyaar ka ehsaas ko aur gehra karega. Jab hum apni zindagi ka naya chapter shuru karenge. Tum taiyyar ho, meri dulhan banne ke liye?
Riya: Vikram, I have always been ready. Tum mere dil ka raaz ho. Haan, Vikram, main tumhari dulhan banne ke liye puri tarah tayyar hoon.
