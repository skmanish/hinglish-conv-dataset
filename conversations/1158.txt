Rohan: Hey Riya, kya haal hai? Aajkal kaisi ho?
Riya: Hey Rohan, main bilkul theek hun! Aur tum?
Rohan: Main bhi theek hun, shukriya. Suno, aajkal Indian cinema mein gamut badal gaya hai na?
Riya: Haan, Rohan. Actors aur filmmakers ne bahut progress ki hai. Now we have more diverse and content-driven movies.
Rohan: Haan, yaar! Earlier, mostly masala movies hi chalti thi, but now we have different genres and stories.
Riya: Absolutely! Movies like 'Pink' and 'Neerja' have broken stereotypes and showcased important social issues.
Rohan: And actors like Rajkummar Rao and Ayushmann Khurrana are really pushing the boundaries with their performances.
Riya: True! They are not bound by conventional roles and are exploring unique characters. It's refreshing to see.
Rohan: Exactly! And the audience is also getting matured. They appreciate meaningful cinema and are not just running after star power.
Riya: Agreed, Rohan. Indian cinema is evolving, giving opportunities to new talents and creating a platform for fresh stories.
Rohan: You know Riya, I would love to be a part of this new wave of Indian cinema someday. It's inspiring!
Riya: That's so amazing, Rohan! I'm sure you'll achieve your dreams and make a mark in the industry.
Rohan: Thanks for your belief in me, Riya. It means a lot. By the way, I have tickets for the opening show of that new movie with Deepika Padukone. Would you like to join me?
Riya: Oh, Rohan! That sounds wonderful. I'd love to go with you!
Rohan: Great! I'll pick you up tomorrow evening then. It'll be a romantic movie date, just like in the movies.
Riya: I'm looking forward to it, Rohan. It's going to be amazing!
Rohan: Can't wait to spend some wonderful time with you, Riya. You make everything better.
Riya: You too, Rohan. And who knows, maybe our love story will be like the ones we see on the big screen.
Rohan: I hope so, Riya. Let's let fate write our story. I'm excited to see what the future holds for us.
Riya: Me too, Rohan. Let's make beautiful memories together, starting with our cinema date tomorrow.
Rohan: Absolutely, Riya. I'll cherish every moment with you. I'm grateful to have you in my life.
Riya: Likewise, Rohan. Let's embrace this new chapter and create our own Bollywood romance. I'm all in.
Rohan: Me too, Riya. Aaj se humara pyaar ki picture shuru hogayi hai!
