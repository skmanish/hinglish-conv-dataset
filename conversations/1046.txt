Rohan: Hey, Pooja! Did you hear about Rahul and Riya? They are the newest couple in college. 
Pooja: Haan, yaar! They are all over Instagram, posting adorable pictures. It's like a fairytale romance.
Rohan: Absolutely! I saw them together at the library yesterday, whispering sweet nothings to each other.
Pooja: Oh, really? It seems like love is in the air. I wonder how they managed to keep it a secret for so long.
Rohan: Well, you know how rumors spread faster than wildfire in our college. They probably wanted to avoid all the unnecessary drama.
Pooja: True that! But honestly, I can't wait for them to be all lovey-dovey openly. It's so cute to watch them being all shy and blushy.
Rohan: I agree, Pooja! It's like they are in their own little world, oblivious to everything else around them.
Pooja: Do you think they will last long, though? You know, college relationships tend to be short-lived.
Rohan: Hmm, it's hard to say. But they do seem genuinely happy together. Maybe they'll prove everyone wrong and stay together forever.
Pooja: Aww, that would be amazing! True love conquers all. I hope they become the ultimate #couplegoals.
Rohan: Definitely! By the way, Pooja, have you ever been in a relationship? I mean, you must have had your fair share of admirers.
Pooja: Well, Rohan, I've had a few crushes here and there, but nothing serious. I guess I've been waiting for that special someone.
Rohan: Oh, I see. So, tell me, what's your idea of a perfect romance? How would your dream guy be?
Pooja: My dream guy would be someone who can make me laugh, has a caring nature, and of course, respects my dreams and aspirations.
Rohan: Oh, Pooja, you just described me! Can I be that dream guy of yours?
Pooja: Haha, nice try Rohan! But I do appreciate your sense of humor. Who knows what the future holds, right?
Rohan: Absolutely, Pooja! Fate has its own way of bringing people together. And who knows, we might just be destined for something special.
Pooja: You never know, Rohan! Life is full of surprises. So, tell me about your idea of a perfect romance. What qualities would your dream girl have?
Rohan: My dream girl would be someone who is intelligent, confident, and has a beautiful smile that can light up the room. And guess what? You fit the bill, Pooja!
Pooja: Oh, stop it! You're just trying to charm me with your sweet talk. But I must admit, you're quite good at it.
Rohan: Well, isn't that a compliment? You have no idea how your smile brightens my day, Pooja. It's like a ray of sunshine in my life.
Pooja: Rohan, you have a way with words! You always manage to make me blush. Maybe there's something more between us than just friendly banter.
Rohan: Maybe, Pooja. Maybe we are meant to be more than just friends. Would you like to find out?
Pooja: I would love to, Rohan. Let's see where this journey takes us. But for now, let's keep enjoying each other's company.
Rohan: Absolutely, Pooja! Let's keep discovering the magic of love together.
