Rohan: Hey Riya, tune dekha mera naya Instagram post? Itne likes aaye hai, I can't believe it!
Riya: Haan, I saw it! Itna saara attention mil raha hai tujhe. How do you maintain such a huge following?
Rohan: Arre yaar, you know I'm always on top of my social media game. Daily posts, trending hashtags, and killer captions. Sab kuchh aata hai, bas thoda sa time lagta hai.
Riya: But doesn't it get exhausting? Having to constantly think about what to post and how to keep your followers engaged?
Rohan: Haan, kabhi kabhi toh bahut pressure hota hai. Pata nahi kya-kya karna padta hai ek acche social media image ke liye. Aur fir dost-banaye-hue followers ko entertain karna bhi.
Riya: That's true. I sometimes feel overwhelmed too. But yaar, have you ever thought about being real and genuine on social media? Showing the real you, instead of just the perfect version?
Rohan: Hmm, wohi toh mein soch raha tha ki kaise apne followers ko batayein ki asli zindagi kaise hai. Par phir socha ki log judge karenge, aur likes kum ho jayenge.
Riya: Log hamesha judge karenge yaar, par jo log tere pasand ke hai, woh tujhe samjhege aur support karenge. Tujhe sirf apne true self ko dikhana chahiye.
Rohan: Tujhe toh sab pata hai, Riya. You always know how to make me feel better. Tere jaisi understanding friend kahan milti hai?
Riya: Achha, friend kaun bol raha hai? Tum toh mere best friend ho, aur shayad kuch aur bhi.
Rohan: Kya? Tumhein toh sirf dosti yaad aati hai?
Riya: Nahi, mujhe toh kuch aur hi yaad aata hai. Shayad hum dono ek dusre ke liye bane hai.
Rohan: Riya, tumne mere mann ki baat chheen li. I've been wanting to tell you how I feel for the longest time. I love you.
Riya: I love you too, Rohan. Tere social media posts ke peeche jitna pressure hai, utna hi pressure dil se yeh kehne mein tha. Par ab main khush hoon.
Rohan: Main bhi khush hoon, Riya. Aur ab mere followers ko bhi pata chalega ki true love kabhi kam followers nahi hote.
