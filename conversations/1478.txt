Rohan: Hey Simran, Diwali is just around the corner! Any special plans for the festival?
Simran: Hi Rohan! I'm really excited for Diwali. I've been thinking of hosting a small get-together at my place. What about you?
Rohan: Sounds great! I can help you with the preparations. We can decorate the house with beautiful diyas and lanterns. 
Simran: That's a wonderful idea, Rohan. And we can also make some delicious sweets and snacks together. What's your favorite Diwali sweet?
Rohan: Without a doubt, it has to be the mouth-watering gulab jamuns. I can't resist their syrupy goodness! 
Simran: Oh, I absolutely love gulab jamuns too! We will definitely make them. I'll be counting on you to make them perfect. 
Rohan: I won't let you down, Simran. My culinary skills are top-notch. By the way, have you picked out your outfit for the festivities yet?
Simran: Not yet, Rohan. I need some fashion advice from you. What do you think I should wear? Traditional or modern?
Rohan: Simran, you look stunning in anything, but I'd suggest a blend of both. A traditional outfit with a modern twist will make you stand out.
Simran: That's a great idea! I'll find something unique that combines tradition and style. You always have the best ideas, Rohan.
Rohan: Thank you, Simran. You flatter me. But seriously, I can't wait to see you dressed up for Diwali. You'll be the most beautiful girl there.
Simran: Stop it, Rohan. You're making me blush. But I'm glad you'll be there. It's always more fun when we celebrate together.
Rohan: Absolutely, Simran. Diwali wouldn't be the same without you. We always have such a fantastic time. By the way, do you remember that one Diwali when we danced together all night?
Simran: Of course, Rohan! That night was magical. We were so lost in the music and the moment. I still get butterflies just thinking about it.
Rohan: Me too, Simran. I'll never forget that night, dancing with you under the shimmering lights. It felt like a dream come true.
Simran: It was indeed a dream come true, Rohan. And this Diwali, let's make more unforgettable memories together. I'm really lucky to have you as my friend.
Rohan: I feel the same, Simran, but I can't help wanting something more. You're not just a friend to me. You mean so much more.
