Raj: Hey Neha, you know what? I was thinking about our favorite teachers today. Who was your favorite teacher in school?
Neha: Oh, Raj! My favorite teacher was Mrs. Sharma. She was not just a great teacher but also very friendly. I really admired her.
Raj: That's nice to hear, Neha. My favorite teacher was Mr. Kapoor. He was a brilliant mathematics teacher, always made the subject interesting. I owe my math skills to him.
Neha: Wow, Raj! I wish I had such a cool math teacher. Math was always a nightmare for me. But thanks to Mr. Kapoor, you are a pro at it now.
Raj: Haha, Neha. Don't worry, I can always help you with math. We can study together sometime, what do you say?
Neha: That sounds like a great idea, Raj. I would love to study with you. But only if you promise to be patient and explain things well.
Raj: Of course, Neha. I'll do my best to help you understand everything. Maybe we can meet this weekend and have a study session?
Neha: That would be amazing, Raj. I can't wait to learn from you. And maybe we can grab some coffee afterward?
Raj: Absolutely, Neha. Coffee sounds perfect. We can reward ourselves for our hard work with a nice cup of coffee. 
Neha: I'm looking forward to it, Raj. You know, I always enjoy spending time with you. It's always fun and exciting.
Raj: Likewise, Neha. I feel the same way. You make everything more enjoyable. I'm glad we connected.
Neha: Me too, Raj. It feels like we have a special bond. I'm grateful for our friendship.
Raj: Friendship is just the beginning, Neha. Who knows what the future holds for us? I feel something more than just friendship.
Neha: Raj, are you saying what I think you're saying? Do you feel the same way I do?
Raj: Neha, I can't deny it anymore. I've fallen for you. You are not just my friend but someone special. I want to be more than just friends with you.
Neha: Raj, you have no idea how happy you've made me by saying this. I feel the same way too. I have fallen for you too, deeply.
Raj: Neha, this is amazing! We should definitely explore this new chapter together. I can't wait to see where this leads us.
Neha: Me neither, Raj. You have brought so much happiness into my life. I can't wait to see what the future holds for us.
Raj: Let's take it one step at a time, Neha. Our journey is just beginning, and I want to experience every moment with you.
Neha: I couldn't agree more, Raj. Together, we can conquer anything. I'm excited to see where love takes us.
