Riya: Hey Akash, have you started learning to drive yet?
Akash: Haan Riya, I've been taking driving lessons for a few weeks now. It's not as easy as I thought it would be!
Riya: Oh really? Mujhe bhi bahut difficulties aa rahi thi, but now it's starting to get better. Ek baar you get the hang of it, you'll do great.
Akash: I hope so! Parallel parking is the hardest for me. It's so confusing!
Riya: Trust me, I struggled with that too. But with practice, you'll soon become a pro. Just remember to bring out your inner Lewis Hamilton!
Akash: Haha, I'll try! But sometimes I get so nervous while driving and end up making silly mistakes.
Riya: Don't worry, it happens to everyone in the beginning. It's all about staying calm and focused. And hey, if things go wrong, I'll always be here to lend a helping hand or in this case, a shoulder to lean on!
Akash: That's really sweet of you, Riya. It's great to have someone supportive like you by my side during this learning process.
Riya: Aww, thank you, Akash. I believe in you! And besides, once you get your driver's license, we can go on awesome road trips together.
Akash: Oh, I can't wait for that! Just imagine the adventures we'll have, exploring new places and creating amazing memories.
Riya: It's going to be incredible! We'll sing our favorite songs, share laughter, and steal random food breaks along the highway. Life will be one big joyride with you, Akash.
Akash: Riya, you always know how to make everything sound so much better. Thanks for motivating me and making this learning journey somewhat romantic too!
Riya: You're welcome, Akash. Learning to drive can be exhausting, but with a little bit of romance and a whole lot of determination, we'll conquer the roads together.
Akash: Absolutely! And who knows, maybe we'll get lost in each other's eyes along the way?
Riya: Haan, that would surely make the GPS jealous!
Akash: Riya, I've never told you this before, but I feel like I'm the luckiest guy to have you in my life. Your support and encouragement mean the world to me.
Riya: And I feel the same way, Akash. You make me believe in myself and bring out the best in me. We're an unstoppable team, on the road and in life.
Akash: Riya, can I ask you something?
Riya: Of course, Akash. You can ask me anything.
Akash: Will you be my co-pilot for life?
Riya: Akash, I'd be honored to be by your side, navigating through the ups and downs of life. Yes, I'll be your co-pilot forever.
Akash: Thank you, Riya. I love you.
Riya: I love you too, Akash. Let's keep driving together, hand in hand, towards a beautiful future.
