Rahul: Hi Riya, kuch din se tujhse baat nahi hui. Kaisi ho?
Riya: Hey Rahul! Haan, mujhe bhi yaad tha ki humein kuch dino se baat nahi hui. Main bilkul theek hu, tum batao?
Rahul: Main bhi theek hu, par tujhse baat karke achha lagta hai. Tune kabhi Indian authors ki books padhi hai?
Riya: Haan, padhti hu kabhi kabhi. Mere favourite Indian author hai Chetan Bhagat. Uske books bahut interesting hote hai. Tere favourite author kon hai?
Rahul: Mera bhi Chetan Bhagat hi hai favorite! Uske writing style bahut engaging hota hai. Which book of his have you enjoyed the most?
Riya: Mujhe 'Five Point Someone' bahut pasand hai. Woh college life ki kahani bahut realistic thi. Tujhe konsi book pasand hai?
Rahul: I love '2 States' yaar! Woh intercultural love story thi and it had such a beautiful blend of emotions. Tujhe kaisi lagi woh book?
Riya: Oh, '2 States' bhi mujhe bahut acchi lagi! Woh ek dilchasp love story hai, aur cultural differences ko beautifully present kiya gaya hai. I really connected with the characters. Any other Indian authors you would recommend?
Rahul: Haan, I recently read 'The White Tiger' by Aravind Adiga. Wah book bhi amazing thi, politics aur socio-economic issues ko bahut acche se touch kiya gaya hai. Tumne padhi hai?
Riya: Nahi, mujhe abhi tak 'The White Tiger' nahi padhi. Shayad agli book meri list mei yeh shamil ho jaaye. I'm always looking for new recommendations. 
Rahul: Definitely, try it out. Main hamesha kehta hu, Indian authors kaafi powerful stories likhte hai, jo hume apne desh ke bare me bhi sochne par majboor kar deti hai.
Riya: Sach kaha! Let's continue exploring more Indian authors, Riya and Rahul style. Hum ek dusre se suggestions lete rahenge, aur saath mei explore karte jayenge.
Rahul: Definitely! And who knows, maybe in the future we can even write our own love story, inspired by these amazing Indian authors.
Riya: Aww, that would be so romantic! Mai toh abhi se excited ho gayi, hamare endless conversations and shared love for books se, who knows what possibilities lie ahead?
Rahul: Haan, who knows! But for now, let's keep discovering new stories and enjoying our own moments together.
