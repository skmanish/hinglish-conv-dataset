Raj: Hi, Simran! Kaisa hai tu?
Simran: Raj, main bilkul theek hu, tum batao?
Raj: Me bhi mast hu, Simran. So, what do you think about the influence of western culture on Indian youth?
Simran: Achcha sawaal hai. Sometimes I feel it's good to embrace the positives, like equality and individualism. But at times, we tend to forget our own cultural roots.
Raj: Haan, I agree. Western culture has taught us to be more open-minded and liberal, but we shouldn't let go of the traditions and values that define us.
Simran: Absolutely, Raj. We should cherish our festivals, our traditional clothing, and the rich history of our country.
Raj: True, Simran. By preserving our culture, we can create a unique fusion, a beautiful blend of the best of both worlds.
Simran: Raj, tu toh bade thoughtful hai. I like that about you.
Raj: Thanks, Simran. Tum bhi bahut samajhdaar ho. I always enjoy our conversations.
Simran: Same here, Raj. You make it easy for me to express myself.
Raj: Simran, you know what I love about you the most?
Simran: Kya?
Raj: Tumhari muskurahat, your smile brightens up my day.
Simran: Wow, Raj! Tum bhi kuch kam nahi ho. Tumhari baatein aur aapki ehsaas mujhe khush kar dete hai.
Raj: Jab hum saath hote hai, I feel like time stops, and it's just you and me.
Simran: Raj, I feel the same. Tumhare saath har pal dil ko sukoon milta hai.
Raj: Simran, tumne mere dil ko chura liya hai. Would you be mine forever?
Simran: Raj, I've been waiting for you to ask. Haan, humesha tumhari rahungi.
Raj: I'm the luckiest guy alive, Simran. I promise to make you the happiest girl in the world.
Simran: And I promise to stand by your side, Raj, through thick and thin.
Raj: Simran, just being with you feels like a fairytale. I love you.
Simran: Raj, I love you too, more than words can express.
