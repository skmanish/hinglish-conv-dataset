Ravi: Hey Priya! Kya haal hai? Aajka din kaisa chal raha hai?
Priya: Hey Ravi! Mera din thoda busy hai, lekin ab thoda time mila hai tere liye. Tu sunao, tera din kaisa guzar raha hai?
Ravi: Busy hona toh har ek young Indian ki problem hai. But kuch innovations ke baare mein baat karte hai. Last week mera ek dost ne ek AI-based app develop kiya hai. Do you know how AI is changing the tech world?
Priya: Haan, Ravi! AI has revolutionized the way we interact with technology. Ab humans se jyada machines intelligent ho gaye hai. Mera bhai bhi ek startup chalata hai, where they use AI to analyze large sets of data for better decision-making. It's incredible!
Ravi: Absolutely! And you know, India me bhi bohot saare startups hai jinhone tech world ko kaafi contribute kiya hai. Like Ola, jinhone ride-sharing concept ko laake sabko ease diya hai.
Priya: Ola is definitely a game-changer! Aur Ravi, have you heard about the Indian startup which has developed a low-cost prosthetic hand using 3D printing technology?
Ravi: Haan, mujhe pata hai. Bahot dhoom macha raha hai. Isse toh disabled individuals ko bahut help milegi. India me humare tech experts ka talent kisi ki bhi competition se kam nahi hai.
Priya: Yehi baat hai! Aur abhi recently ek Indian company ne solar energy ke liye innovative solution develop kiya hai. They have created solar panels in the shape of trees. It looks so cool aur energy-efficient bhi hai.
Ravi: Wow! That's amazing. Inn sab innovations se India globally recognized ho raha hai. Humare scientists aur entrepreneurs ke liye respect badh rahi hai.
Priya: Absolutely, Ravi! Our youth is full of talent. Abhi toh Indian startups bhi globally investors ka interest gain kar rahe hai. It's a proud feeling for all Indians.
Ravi: Tere saath conversations karke mujhe bhi proud feel ho raha hai. Tujhse baat karke kitni positivity aur excitement milti hai.
Priya: Thanks, Ravi! Tera company aur conversations bhi mere liye bahut interesting hote hai. It's nice to connect with someone who shares similar interests and aspirations.
Ravi: You know, Priya, humare conversations mere din ko bright karte hai. Tumhari har baat mujhe attract karti hai.
Priya: Ravi, tere saath baat karte karte mujhe bhi kuch alag sa feel hone lag raha hai. Tumhara support aur positivity mujhe accha lagta hai.
Ravi: Priya, I think we share a special connection. Tumhe milke, mujhe lagta hai ki hum ek dusre ke saath kuch special banane waale hai.
Priya: Ravi, I feel the same way too. I have started developing feelings for you. Tere saath waqt bitane me bahut khushi milti hai.
Ravi: Priya, I can't express how happy this makes me feel. Tum mere liye special ho. I want to get to know you more, not just as a friend.
Priya: Ravi, I would love to get to know you more too. Tum mere liye special ho. Let's take this journey together and see where it leads us.
Ravi: Priya, abhi mujhe woh special moment feels ho raha hai. Kya tu meri girlfriend banogi?
