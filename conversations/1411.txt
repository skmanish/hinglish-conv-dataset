Rohan: Hey, Shreya! Kaisa chal raha hai tera internship?
Shreya: Rohan! Mera internship mast chal raha hai. Kaam bohot interesting hai. Tera kaisa hai?
Rohan: Mera bhi kaafi acha hai. I'm interning at a startup and getting hands-on experience. Par work pressure kaafi hai.
Shreya: Haan yaar, I can understand. Mere supervisor constantly deadlines set karte rehte hai. Kabhi kabhi stress ho jata hai. Tujhe kaise handle karte hai?
Rohan: Honestly, sometimes it gets overwhelming. Lekin I try to set realistic targets and prioritize my work. Plus, music sunte hue relax hone ka try karta hu. Tere liye koi tip hai?
Shreya: Mai toh often breaks leti hu. Thoda social media pe time spend karne se mind relax ho jata hai. Aur yaad rakh, team members se support lena bhi important hota hai.
Rohan: Achcha hai tune kaha. Haan, mera team kaafi cooperative hai. Koi bhi doubt ho, they are always there to help. Teri team mates kaisi hai?
Shreya: Meri team mates bhi friendly hai. In fact, kabhi kabhi lunch breaks me hum jokes sun kar hasne lagte hai. Gives me a sense of belonging.
Rohan: That sounds fun! Mere colleagues bhi kaafi mast hai. Ek do bar humne office ke baad dinner plan kiya tha, it was really enjoyable. 
Shreya: Wow, mujhe bhi aise plan banane chahiye. Kaam ke alawa bhi bonding important hoti hai na?
Rohan: Absolutely! Waise, kuch yaad hai jo tu internship se sikhne wali ho?
Shreya: Ek important lesson hai punctuality ka. Bosses value karte hai jab hum time pe work complete karte hai. Tujhe kya sikhaya hai internship?
Rohan: Mere liye bhi punctuality kaafi important hai. But I've also learned the art of multitasking. Ek sath kaam kar ke time management ho jata hai.
Shreya: Sahi hai, multitasking skills aane wale time me helpful hote hai. By the way, kabhi kabhi boredom feel hota hai job me?
Rohan: Honestly, I have felt bored at times. But I try to take up new challenges and keep myself engaged. Tu kaise deal karti hai boredom se?
Shreya: Mai allocate karte hu apna kaam ke saath thoda sa time, jaise koi hobby pursue karne me ya books padhne me. Aur sometimes, friends ko message karne se bhi mood improve hota hai.
Rohan: That's a great idea. Tu kaunsi hobby pursue karti hai in your free time?
Shreya: Mujhe photography bohot pasand hai. Whenever I get some time, I love to capture moments. Tujhe koi hobbies hai?
Rohan: Photography toh mere bhi dil ki baat hai. But I'm passionate about playing guitar. Kabhi kabhi office ke breaks me strum karta hu. 
Shreya: That's amazing! Kaafi creative hobbies hai teri. Kya hum kabhi ek sath jamming session kare?
Rohan: Definitely! I would love that. Itna common interests find karne pe, humein toh acche friends banne hi the.
Shreya: Haan, bilkul! Friends toh ban gaye, lekin ab kuch aur bhi chahiye.
Rohan: Pehle friendship strong karein, then we can explore what else we want. Kya hum weekend pe dinner pe jaye?
Shreya: Sounds like a plan! Dinner pe baat karte karte pata chal jayega kya aur chahiye humein. 
Rohan: Perfect! Mera internship aur tere experiences ke beech ka ye romantic moment ho jaye?
