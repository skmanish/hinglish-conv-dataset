Rohan: Hey Riya, kya haal hai? Tumhara din kaisa tha?
Riya: Hey Rohan! Mera din theek tha, aur tumhara?
Rohan: Mera bhi theek tha, Riya. Suno, aaj hum traditional wear aur western wear ke baare me debate kar sakte hai?
Riya: Haan, zaroor! Mera opinion hai ki traditional wear always looks elegant and graceful. Tum kya sochte ho?
Rohan: Well, mujhe to western wear bhi acchi lagti hai. Especially jab koi cute dress pehenti hai, it adds a modern touch to her personality.
Riya: Achha? Lekin traditional wear symbolizes our rich cultural heritage, it reflects our traditions and values.
Rohan: That's true, but western wear also allows us to express our individuality and style. Itâ€™s versatile and more comfortable too.
Riya: Haan, comfort to hai, lekin traditional attire me woh grace hai jo kisi aur dress me nahi hoti. Woh saari, lehenga ya shervani, sab beautiful lagti hai.
Rohan: True, traditional wear mein koi doubt nahi hai, lekin western wear bhi kuch khaas hai. It can make anyone look trendy and fashionable.
Riya: Trendy to ho sakta hai, lekin traditional wear ko koi compete nahi kar sakta. Woh weddings, festivals, and special occasions mein shaandaar lagta hai.
Rohan: Haan, woh to hai, lekin western wear allows us to explore different styles and experiment with our looks. It brings out the confidence in us.
Riya: Confidence to traditional wear me bhi hota hai. Jab tak hum apne traditional attire me comfortable feel karte hai, tab tak hum confident dikhte hai.
Rohan: You're right, Riya. Traditional wear ka apna alag hi charm hai. Aur tum traditional attire me hamesha stunning lagti ho.
Riya: Thank you, Rohan. Lekin mujhe bhi lagta hai ki tum western wear me hi dashing lagte ho.
Rohan: Aww, that's sweet of you to say, Riya. Tumhara ye compliment mujhe behad khush kar raha hai.
Riya: Sach bol rahi hu, Rohan. Tumhara style hamesha pleasing lagta hai. Waise, aaj shaam kya kar rahe ho?
Rohan: Well, agar tumhara kuch plans nahi hai toh milte hai aur ek coffee peete hai. Kya kehti ho?
Riya: That sounds good, Rohan. I'd love to spend some more time with you. Chalo, milte hai waha 6 baje, what say?
Rohan: Perfect, Riya! I'm really looking forward to it. 6 baje waha milte hai.
