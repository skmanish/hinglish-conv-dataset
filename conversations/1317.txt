Rahul: Hey Riya, kaisi hai? Did you have a chance to go to any beach this summer? 
Riya: Hey Rahul! Main bilkul theek hoon. Haan, mujhe ek dost ki shaadi pe beach pe jana hua tha. It was such a fun experience! 
Rahul: That sounds amazing! Kaunsi beach pe gayi thi? 
Riya: Hum Goa gaye the. It was so beautiful, yaar! The sun, the sand, and the waves - sab kuch tha! 
Rahul: Wow, Goa wale beaches are something else! I hope you enjoyed the beach parties there too. 
Riya: Oh yes, beach parties were full of energy and masti. Bina dance kiye, kaise enjoy karte? 
Rahul: True, dance toh banta hai. So, did you try any water sports? I always wanted to try parasailing. 
Riya: Haan, maine bhi parasailing kiya tha! The feeling of flying above the sea was just exhilarating. You should definitely try it sometime. 
Rahul: That sounds incredible! I will definitely give it a shot next time. By the way, did you explore any nearby shacks for some lip-smacking food? 
Riya: Oh yes, Goa ke shacks mein khaane ka alag hi mazaa hota hai. The seafood there is just too delicious to resist. I had the best prawns ever! 
Rahul: You're making me hungry now! I need to plan a Goa trip soon. But tell me, did you witness any beautiful sunsets on the beach? 
Riya: How can I forget, yaar? The sunsets were absolutely breathtaking. It felt like the whole world was painted in shades of orange and pink. You should have seen it! 
Rahul: I can only imagine, Riya. Your descriptions are making me wish I was there. Goa trip together next time, what say? 
Riya: I think that would be so much fun, Rahul. Exploring beaches, trying water sports, dancing at beach parties, and enjoying each other's company. 
Rahul: Exactly! Just imagine strolling on the beach, hand in hand, feeling the sand beneath our feet, and watching the waves. It would be a dream come true. 
Riya: It sounds like a perfect plan, Rahul. Let's make it happen. 
Rahul: I can't wait, Riya. You have no idea how excited I am for our beach adventure. 
Riya: Me too, Rahul. This is going to be the best trip ever! I'm looking forward to making unforgettable memories with you on the beach.
