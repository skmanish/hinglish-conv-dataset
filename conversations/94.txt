Rahul: Hey Riya, tu aaj itni sundar lag rahi hai!
Riya: Oh Rahul, tum bhi na, flirting ka koi time nahi hota tujhe.
Rahul: Abhi toh time nikal hi liya. By the way, tere dada-dadi ne tumse kabhi partition ke baare mein baat ki hai?
Riya: Haan Rahul, they often share their stories from that time. Itna fascinating hota hai unki zindagi ke baare mein sunna.
Rahul: Sach mein, I can only imagine how difficult it must have been for them.
Riya: Haan, unki zindagi mein bahut struggle tha, but they always talk about the unity and love among people during those times.
Rahul: That's true, we should definitely learn from them. Sabke dil mein ek doosre ke liye pyaar tha.
Riya: Aur unke saath rehna aur unki stories sunna brings back a sense of history and tradition.
Rahul: Absolutely, I feel connected to our roots when I listen to them.
Riya: Yeh sab baatein sunte- sunte, mujhe bhi apne dada-dadi ki yaad aa gayi hai.
Rahul: Aur sirf yaad nahi, wohi feeling aa rahi hai ki unke zamane mein wapas jaa ke unki zindagi jeeyun.
Riya: Achcha hai na, humare grandparents ki stories se hume ek new perspective milta hai.
Rahul: Haan, Riya, you always have that way of looking at things that I admire.
Riya: Thanks, Rahul. Tumhe pata hai, jab tak grandparents ke saath amazing time spend karte hai tab tak hum inse kitna kuchh seekh sakte hai.
Rahul: Absolutely, Riya. Humare grandparents ki experiences bahut valuable hai humare liye.
Riya: I totally agree, Rahul. Ussi valuable experiences ki wajah se hume aur apne relationship ko strong banana chahiye.
Rahul: Riya, tumse yeh baat karna and samay bitana, isme mera dil khush ho jaata hai.
Riya: Mera dil bhi khush hota hai, Rahul. Tumhare saath aur aise conversations karne ke liye.
Rahul: Riya, I don't want this conversation to end here. Tum mere liye special ho, and want to be with you.
Riya: Rahul, even I feel the same way. Tum bhi mere liye special ho. I want to be with you too.
Rahul: Riya, yeh sab stories ke baad, I feel like we have a connection that goes beyond just being friends.
Riya: Rahul, you are right. Our bond is stronger than friendships, and I love that about us.
Rahul: Riya, kya tum mere sath relationship banana pasand karogi?
Riya: Rahul, mujhe bhi tumse pyaar hai. Yes, I would love to be in a relationship with you.
Rahul: Riya, I can't tell you how happy I am to hear that. Tumse pehle kabhi kisi se aisa connection nahi mehsoos kiya hai.
Riya: Rahul, even I feel the same way. Humare relationship ke liye main bhi bahut excited hoon.
Rahul: Riya, can I hold your hand? I want to feel this new beginning with you.
Riya: Of course, Rahul. Apna haath do, and let's embark on this beautiful journey together.
