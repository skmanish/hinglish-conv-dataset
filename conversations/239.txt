Rohan: Hey Priya! Kaise ho? Long time no talk!
Priya: Hey Rohan! Haan, I'm good. Tum batao, kaise chal rahi hai life?
Rohan: Oh, you know, the usual! College, assignments, and the pressure to maintain a social media image!
Priya: I totally get it! It's like everyone expects us to have a perfect life on Instagram, right?
Rohan: Absolutely! And the more followers you have, the more pressure to keep up that image.
Priya: Haan yaar! Even I feel like I have to constantly post something exciting to keep my followers engaged.
Rohan: True, it can be exhausting sometimes. I mean, we should be living in the moment, not for the camera.
Priya: Exactly! But it's hard not to be influenced by these expectations. I often find myself comparing my life to others'.
Rohan: Don't worry, Priya! You're amazing just the way you are. And your Instagram doesn't define you.
Priya: Thanks, Rohan. That means a lot! But I still can't help feeling the pressure sometimes.
Rohan: I understand, Priya. It happens to the best of us. But remember, it's important to be true to yourself.
Priya: You're right, Rohan. Maybe I should focus more on enjoying real moments instead of worrying about the virtual ones.
Rohan: That's the spirit! Life is meant to be lived, not filtered for likes. And your true friends will always support you.
Priya: You always know how to make me feel better, Rohan. Thank you for reminding me of what really matters.
Rohan: Anytime, Priya. That's what friends are for, right? So, how about we take a break from the virtual world and go grab some coffee?
Priya: I'd love that, Rohan! It's time to unplug from social media and enjoy some quality time with a special someone.
