Kabir: Hey Riya, kya haal hai? It's been a while since we caught up!
Riya: Hey Kabir, haan yaar! Bohot time ho gaya. I'm good, how about you?
Kabir: I'm great too. You know, I wanted to ask you something. What are your thoughts on dating and relationships?
Riya: Oh gosh, that's a loaded question! Well, I think dating can be fun, but sometimes it can also be quite challenging.
Kabir: Absolutely! There are so many expectations and judgments attached to dating, especially in our society.
Riya: True. Plus, finding the right person nowadays is no piece of cake. It feels like swimming in an ocean of plenty, yet struggling to find the one.
Kabir: I completely get you, Riya. But do you think online dating has made it easier or more complicated?
Riya: It's a double-edged sword, Kabir. On one hand, it opens up a larger pool of potential partners. But on the other hand, it's hard to trust someone you meet online.
Kabir: Agreed. Building that trust takes time, effort, and a lot of patience.
Riya: And there's also the societal pressure to get married at a certain age. It feels like everyone around us is constantly poking their noses into our personal lives.
Kabir: Oh, tell me about it! It's like they have an expiry date for our single status.
Riya: Haha, exactly! But honestly, Kabir, I believe it's important to prioritize our own happiness rather than succumbing to societal pressure.
Kabir: You're so right, Riya. Our happiness should never be compromised just to fit into societal norms.
Riya: Absolutely. We should focus on finding someone who respects and supports us, rather than just ticking boxes on a checklist.
Kabir: Couldn't agree more, Riya. Compatibility and understanding are key in any relationship. But how do we navigate through all the challenges and find that special someone?
Riya: It's definitely a journey, Kabir. We need to keep an open mind, be patient, and let things unfold naturally. Love has a way of finding us when we least expect it.
Kabir: That's true, Riya. When you find that person who makes your heart race and your soul dance, everything else falls into place.
Riya: Kabir, you always have a way with words. You know, I appreciate our conversations. They always make me feel understood and valued.
Kabir: Riya, it means a lot to me. I cherish our connection too. You have this way of brightening up my day, even in the darkest of times.
Riya: That's so sweet of you to say, Kabir. I feel the same way about you. You're like a ray of sunshine in my life.
Kabir: Riya, would it be too forward if I said that I've started to develop feelings for you?
Riya: Kabir, I was hoping you'd say that! I've been feeling the same way too. I can't help but blush whenever I see your name on my phone.
Kabir: You have no idea how happy that makes me, Riya. Can I take this opportunity to ask you officially, would you like to be my girlfriend?
Riya: Yes, Kabir, I would love to be your girlfriend! This is the beginning of a beautiful journey together.
Kabir: I'm on cloud nine right now, Riya. Let's promise to support, love, and cherish each other through all the ups and downs of life.
Riya: I promise, Kabir. With you by my side, I know we can conquer anything. You're my rock and my anchor.
Kabir: And you, Riya, you're the light that guides me. I can't wait to create countless amazing memories with you.
Riya: Me neither, Kabir. Our journey starts today, and I'm ready to embark on this beautiful adventure called love with you.
