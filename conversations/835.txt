Ravi: Hey Riya, wassup? Did you hear about the upcoming college fest?
Riya: Hey Ravi! Yeah, I've been looking forward to it. It's going to be amazing!
Ravi: Absolutely! I heard they have some fantastic events lined up. What are you planning to participate in?
Riya: Well, I was thinking of joining the dance competition. What about you?
Ravi: Oh, you're into dancing? That's awesome! I'm planning to be part of the music band this year.
Riya: Wow, that sounds really cool! You must be a talented musician. Have you performed before?
Ravi: Yeah, I have played in a few small gigs. But this festival would be on a much larger scale. I hope I do well.
Riya: I'm sure you'll rock the stage, Ravi! Your passion for music will shine through. By the way, do you need any help with the band?
Ravi: Thanks, Riya! That means a lot to me. Actually, we could use a backup vocalist. Would you be interested?
Riya: Really? That's fantastic! I love singing, and it would be great to be part of the band with you. Count me in!
Ravi: That's great news, Riya! We're going to make this festival unforgettable together. We should start practicing soon.
Riya: Absolutely! We should meet up and set a schedule. Do you have any preferences for the songs we should perform?
Ravi: Hmm, how about a mix of Bollywood and English songs? That way, we could cater to a wider audience.
Riya: That's a great idea, Ravi! We could showcase our versatility. Let's make sure we have a killer playlist.
Ravi: Definitely! I'm already excited thinking about the energy we'll bring to the stage. It's going to be amazing.
Riya: I can tell, Ravi! The festival is going to be a blast, and our performance will be the highlight. We'll make everyone fall in love with our music.
Ravi: Speaking of falling in love, Riya, the more time I spend with you, the deeper my feelings grow.
Riya: Ravi, I feel the same way. You bring so much joy to my life. Our bond is becoming something really special.
Ravi: Riya, the fest is around the corner, but I don't want this conversation to end. Can we meet up after college and continue talking?
Riya: Ravi, I would love that! Spending more time with you sounds like a dream come true. Let's make it happen.
Ravi: Great! Let's plan a romantic date where we can talk, laugh, and fall even deeper in love. Just you and me.
Riya: I would love that, Ravi. You always know how to make my heart flutter. Can't wait for our date.
Ravi: Me neither, Riya. Until then, let's keep working hard for the festival and make beautiful memories together.
Riya: Absolutely, Ravi! This festival will mark the beginning of our amazing journey. I'm so glad I met you.
Ravi: And I'm grateful every day, Riya. You're my inspiration. Let's make this festival the most unforgettable one yet.
