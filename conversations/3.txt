Akash: Hey Shruti! Tumne college ke bare mein plans soche hai? Studying in India or studying abroad?
Shruti: Hi Akash! Haan, mujhe bahut sochne ka mauka mila hai. Par mujhe lagta hai ki studying abroad better option hogi. What do you think?
Akash: Achha, par kya tumne socha hai ki studying abroad kaafi expensive hota hai? We have some top-notch colleges in India too.
Shruti: Haan, woh toh hai. But studying abroad gives us exposure to different cultures and a chance to explore something new.
Akash: That's true, par India mein bhi hum diverse culture aur tradition dekh sakte hai. Moreover, tu apne family ke paas reh paayegi.
Shruti: Haan, Akash, mujhe apni family se separation nahi chahti. Lekin mereko lagta hai ki global exposure is important for personal growth.
Akash: Tum sahi keh rahi ho, par tropics ke alawa aur bhi countries hote hai jahan weather tujhe pasand aayega.
Shruti: True, Akash. But when it comes to quality education, foreign countries have an edge. Unke facilities aur teaching methods are more advanced.
Akash: Haan, yeh bhi sahi hai. Lekin India mein bhi prestigious institutes hai jaise IITs aur IIMs. Unka level bahut high hota hai.
Shruti: That's right, par maine suna hai ki foreign universities offer more scholarships and opportunities for research. That can boost our careers.
Akash: Haan, par humare desh mein bhi scholarships aur internships available hai. Agar hum hard work kare, toh successful banne ka mauka hai.
Shruti: Absolutely, Akash! But you know, studying abroad gives us a chance to become more independent and learn valuable life skills.
Akash: Haan, woh toh hai. Lekin yaha study karne se hum apne roots and culture se connected reh sakte hai. That's equally important, isn't it?
Shruti: Definitely, Akash. Humara culture aur heritage humare liye amulya hai. But don't you think studying abroad can broaden our horizons too?
Akash: Haan, Shruti. Maine bhi socha hai ki hum globally competitive ban sakte hai. Lekin fir bhi, mujhe apna India loyal feel hota hai.
Shruti: I understand, Akash. Lekin aaj kal technology ne distances kam kar diye hai. Aur hum globally connected hai.
Akash: Hmmm, tu sahi keh rahi hai. Abhi sab virtual ho gaya hai. Lekin kuch cheezein virtual experience se nahi badal sakti, like street food aur festivals!
Shruti: Hahaha, bilkul sahi bola. India mein hi woh taste aur fun hai jo kahin aur nahi hai. Aur tujhe koi special street food yaad hai?
Akash: Haan, college ke samay doston ke saath ghumte hue Vada Pav khaana, woh kabhi nahi bhool sakte hai!
Shruti: Oh, Vada Pav! Woh toh mere bhi favorite hai. Hum college mein milte hai aur wapas Vada Pav khaate hai, deal?
Akash: Deal! Par milna toh pehle hi chahiye, jo tu busy schedule wale college mein planning kar rahi hai!
Shruti: Haha, for sure Akash. Hum zaroor milenge. Magar abhi ek interesting baat batao, which country would you choose to study abroad?
Akash: Hmm, I think I would choose the United States. They have some amazing colleges and I've always been fascinated by American culture.
Shruti: Oh, that's great! And guess what, even I've been dreaming of studying in the US. Maybe we can explore this dream together?
Akash: Wow, Shruti! That sounds like an exciting plan. Yeh dream explore karte hai aur shayad humare dreams ek romantic moment mein kulminates ho jaye!
Shruti: Haha, that would be amazing, Akash. But let's focus on our college applications first, and let destiny take care of the rest.
Akash: Absolutely, Shruti. Abhi toh humne sirf college plans discuss kiye hai, ab future ke surprises ka intezaar karte hai!
Shruti: True, Akash. Chalo, excitement aur nervousness ke saath hum college life mein step karne ka wait karte hai. All the best to us!
Akash: All the best, Shruti! And remember, humare college plans ke saath saath, hamari dosti bhi strong honi chahiye.
Shruti: Of course, Akash. Dosti toh humari priority hai. Let's create beautiful memories together, on this new chapter of our lives!
