Rahul: Hey Riya! Tere Instagram posts toh super hit hote hai! How do you manage to maintain such a huge following?
Riya: Thanks, Rahul! It's not easy, yaar. You have to be constantly active and engage with your followers. It's like a full-time job!
Rahul: I can imagine. It must be so much pressure to always have the perfect picture and caption, right?
Riya: Absolutely! You have to think about the lighting, angles, filters, and then come up with a witty caption that gets people's attention. It's exhausting sometimes.
Rahul: I can see that. But don't you think it's all too superficial? People just focus on the number of followers and likes instead of genuine connections.
Riya: I completely agree, Rahul. It's sad how people judge your popularity based on numbers. It's like living in a virtual popularity contest.
Rahul: True, Riya. Sometimes I feel like taking a break from social media, but then I worry about losing touch with everyone.
Riya: Same here, Rahul. It's become so intertwined with our lives that it's almost impossible to disconnect. We're constantly chasing validation.
Rahul: That's the sad reality. But hey, I follow you because I genuinely like your posts. You don't need to worry about impressing anyone.
Riya: Aw, Rahul, that's so sweet of you to say. It's refreshing to know that you appreciate the real me behind the social media facade.
Rahul: Of course, Riya. I've always found you beautiful, inside and out. Your genuine smile is much more captivating than any filtered picture.
Riya: Rahul, you always know how to make me blush. Thank you for seeing beyond the superficial and valuing the real connection we have.
Rahul: Riya, you're amazing and deserve to be appreciated for who you truly are. So, let's forget about social media for a while and just enjoy each other's company.
