Rohan: Yaar, Ritu! Remember the annual day in class 10? It was so much fun, right?
Ritu: Ohh yes, Rohan! I had a blast that day. The cultural performances were amazing!
Rohan: Absolutely! And the fashion show? You were looking stunning in that traditional attire.
Ritu: Hehe, thank you, Rohan! You were no less, looking dapper in that formal suit of yours.
Rohan: Do you remember the time when we danced on stage together during the group performance?
Ritu: Of course, how can I forget! We had so much chemistry, didn't we?
Rohan: It felt like the whole world disappeared when we were dancing together. You were the star of that show.
Ritu: Stop it, Rohan! You're making me blush. But honestly, dancing with you was a dream come true.
Rohan: Well, I have a confession to make. I always had a crush on you since that day.
Ritu: Really? Why didn't you ever let me know, silly boy?
Rohan: I was scared of losing our beautiful friendship, Ritu. But now I can't hold it back anymore.
Ritu: Rohan, I always liked you too. I was just waiting for you to say it.
Rohan: Oh, Ritu! I wish I knew it earlier. We wasted so much time dancing around our feelings.
Ritu: Let's not dwell on the past. We have an amazing future ahead, together.
Rohan: I can't wait to make more beautiful memories with you, Ritu. You're the one for me.
Ritu: And you're the one for me, Rohan. Let's make this love story the best one ever.
Rohan: I promise, Ritu. We'll create a journey filled with love, laughter, and unforgettable moments.
Ritu: I'm excited for every step of this journey, Rohan. You're my partner in crime forever.
Rohan: Forever and always, Ritu. I love you.
Ritu: I love you too, Rohan.
