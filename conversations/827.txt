Riya: Hey, Rohan! Remember that time when I accidentally called our Math teacher "Maa" instead of "Madam" in front of the entire class?
Rohan: Oh my god, Riya! That was hilarious. Everyone burst out laughing, and even our teacher couldn't stop herself from giggling. I don't think I've ever seen you turn that red in embarrassment before!
Riya: Ugh, it was so embarrassing! I wanted to disappear into thin air. But hey, you almost tripped on the stage during our annual function, right?
Rohan: Yeah, that was a close call! I tripped on the edge of the stage, but I managed to hold on to the curtain and saved myself from falling flat on my face. It was pure luck, I tell you.
Riya: Haha, I wish I could've witnessed that. But you know what? One time, I accidentally left my skirt pinned up in my bag, and it fell out in the middle of the hallway!
Rohan: No way! What did you do then?
Riya: I quickly tried to pick it up, but it was too late. It seemed like the whole school saw it. I was so mortified, I couldn't look anyone in the eye for days. Good thing it was just an inner skirt, though!
Rohan: That's pretty embarrassing, Riya. But here's another embarrassing moment of mine - during a science experiment, I mixed up the chemicals, and the whole lab smelled like rotten eggs for weeks!
Riya: Oh no! I can only imagine the chaos that caused. But you know me, right? I once fell asleep during a class presentation and woke up to everyone clapping. I had no idea why until later when my best friend told me I had been snoring on stage!
Rohan: Hahaha, I can't stop laughing! I wish I could've seen that. You must have been so surprised when you woke up to applause. But hey, these embarrassing moments make school life memorable, don't you think?
Riya: Absolutely! Despite the embarrassment, they create stories we'll laugh about for years. And it's better to have such stories than a boring and monotonous school experience, right?
Rohan: Absolutely right, Riya. And I'm glad we could share these embarrassing moments with each other. It's like our own little inside joke.
Riya: Yeah, it feels special. By the way, Rohan, I really enjoy talking to you. You always make me laugh and forget about everything else. You're such an amazing friend.
Rohan: Thank you, Riya. I feel the same way about you. Talking to you is the highlight of my day. You bring so much joy into my life.
