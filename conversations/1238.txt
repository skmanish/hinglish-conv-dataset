Rohan: Hey Simran! Tere ko pata hai, next month college choices ke liye apply karna hoga, I'm so confused! 
Simran: Haan yaar, mujhe bhi bahut confusion hai. You know na, maine commerce stream liya hai, but now I'm not sure about my future career aspirations. 
Rohan: Don't worry, Simran! Hamari zindagi mein aise confusions hote rehte hai. But, we should definitely discuss our options and figure it out together. 
Simran: Haan, you're right, Rohan! So, which colleges are you considering?
Rohan: Main toh thinking of going to St. Xavier's College. It has a great commerce department and khuch talented professors bhi hai wahaan.
Simran: Oh wow, that sounds amazing! Maine socha tha ki DU mein admission lenge, but abhi tak final decision nahi hua hai. 
Rohan: Delhi University? Bahut accha option hai, Simran! Wahaan ka environment bhi bahut vibrant hota hai. 
Simran: Haan, I've heard great things about DU. Aur tere future career aspirations kya hai? Kya socha hai decide karne ke liye?
Rohan: Well, I've always been interested in business and entrepreneurship. So, I'm thinking of pursuing BBA toh baad mein MBA kar sakoon.
Simran: That's awesome, Rohan! Tujhme woh business ki spark hai, I'm sure tu successful businessman banega.
Rohan: Thanks, Simran! Tumhe kya career mein interest hai? Kuch plan bana rakha hai?
Simran: Honestly, Rohan, mujhe abhi tak clarity nahi mili hai. Maybe I'll explore some internship opportunities toh mujhe pata lagega ki mujhe kya pasand hai.
Rohan: That's a great approach, Simran! Exploring different fields will definitely help you figure out your passion.
Simran: Thanks, Rohan! Tujhe itna samajhne ke liye. Tu sach mein ek understanding and supportive friend hai.
Rohan: Thanks, Simran! Tum bhi bahut understanding aur supportive ho. Bas... ek friend nahi, kuch zyada bhi ho sakte hai.
Simran: Rohan, tu bhi na! Yeh kya bol diya?
Rohan: Sach mein, Simran. Kya hum yeh friendship... thoda aur special banaye?
Simran: Rohan, I think I'd like that too. Tum mere best friend ho, aur maybe future mein...kuch aur bhi ban sakte ho.
Rohan: That's all I've ever wanted, Simran. We'll figure out our college choices and streams together and support each other in achieving our dreams. 
Simran: Thank you for being there, Rohan. I'm really excited about our future together.
Rohan: And I'm equally excited, Simran. Abhi se, teri saath career journey start ho gayi hai, aur yeh toh sirf pehla chapter hai.
