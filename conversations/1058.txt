Rohan: Hey Simran! Kya haal hai? 
Simran: Hey Rohan! Sab badhiya hai. Tu bata, kya chal raha hai?
Rohan: Yaar, recently I watched this amazing stand-up comedy show on Netflix. It was so hilarious!
Simran: Ohh really? Kaunsa show dekha tune?
Rohan: Kumail Nanjiani ka show 'Ab Dilli Door Nahi'. Sahi maarta hai yaar! Tereko bhi dekhna chahiye.
Simran: Oh, I've heard about it. Mujhe bhi dekhna chahiye phir. I love stand-up comedians. Who's your favorite Indian stand-up comedian?
Rohan: Mere favorite toh Zakir Khan hai. Uska humor kitna relatable hota hai yaar.
Simran: Haha, true! Uski shayari bhi zabardast hai. I like Kanan Gill too, his timing is impeccable.
Rohan: Sahi choice hai, Simran! You have good taste in comedy. Have you been to any live comedy shows?
Simran: Nahin yaar, I've always wanted to. Par abhi kabhi mauka hi nahi mila.
Rohan: Koi baat nahi, we should definitely plan to go to one together. It'll be so much fun.
Simran: Haan, bilkul! That sounds like a great idea. We'd have a great time laughing together.
Rohan: Tumhare saath hasna toh mere liye sabse important hai. Tumhari hasi dekh kar hi mera din ban jata hai.
Simran: Awww, Rohan! Tum bhi na, kitna sweet bolte ho. Tumhari baaton se mujhe bhi bahut khushi milti hai.
Rohan: Sachchi? That's all I want, Simran. To make you happy.
Simran: You always manage to make me smile, Rohan. You're a genuinely funny and caring person.
Rohan: Bas tumhara pyaar aur support chahiye, Simran. Together, we can conquer the world.
Simran: I believe in you, Rohan. Tumhare saath har raste pe chalna chahti hoon.
Rohan: That means everything to me, Simran. You're my perfect partner in comedy and in life.
Simran: And you're mine, Rohan. Abhi humare saath hasi-mazak ka silsila shuru ho gaya hai, and I hope it never ends.
Rohan: Kabhi nahi hoga, Simran. Hum hamesha saath mein hanste rahenge. I love you.
Simran: I love you too, Rohan. You complete me.
