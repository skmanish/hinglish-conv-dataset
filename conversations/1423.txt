Riya: Hey Rohan, have you watched any good series on Netflix or Amazon Prime lately?
Rohan: Haan Riya, I just finished binge-watching "The Family Man" on Amazon Prime. It was amazing! What about you?
Riya: Oh, I loved that one too! Manoj Bajpayee's acting was top-notch. Have you seen "Sacred Games"?
Rohan: Yes, Riya! "Sacred Games" was mind-blowing. Nawazuddin Siddiqui stole the show. Have you watched "Mirzapur"?
Riya: Not yet, but I've heard so much about it. I'm planning to watch it next. Have you seen "Money Heist" on Netflix?
Rohan: Oh, definitely! "Money Heist" is fantastic. The suspense and plot twists keep you hooked till the end. Have you seen "Stranger Things"?
Riya: Yes, Rohan! I absolutely love "Stranger Things". The 80s nostalgia, supernatural elements, and the friendship between the kids make it so captivating. Have you watched "Narcos"?
Rohan: No, Riya, I haven't seen "Narcos" yet. Is it worth watching? Any other recommendations?
Riya: Absolutely, Rohan! "Narcos" is a gripping series based on the drug cartels. You should also check out "Breaking Bad" and "Game of Thrones" if you haven't seen them already. But hey, we should watch one together sometime!
Rohan: That sounds like a great plan, Riya! How about we start with "Mirzapur"? We can get lost in the world of Guddu Pandit and Kaleen Bhaiya together.
Riya: That sounds perfect, Rohan! Let's make it a movie night this weekend. I'll bring the snacks, and you can handle the playlist.
Rohan: Sounds like a deal, Riya! I can't wait to spend some quality time with you.
