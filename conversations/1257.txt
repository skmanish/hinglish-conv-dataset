Rishi: Hey Simran, kaisa chal raha hai? I heard your family is planning a big fat Indian wedding soon.
Simran: Hey Rishi, sab thik chal raha hai! Haan, bilkul sahi suna hai, we are indeed preparing for a grand wedding celebration.
Rishi: Wah, yaar! I can only imagine the challenges you must be facing. Indian weddings are no joke! 
Simran: Tell me about it! So many details to take care of, like the venue, guest list, decoration, and of course, finding the perfect outfits. It's overwhelming sometimes.
Rishi: Absolutely, but I'm sure it will be worth it. Ek baar shadi complete ho jaye, the joy and happiness will be unparalleled.
Simran: That's true! Despite the stress, an Indian wedding brings so much excitement, love, and bonding with family and friends.
Rishi: Absolutely, it's a beautiful way to celebrate the union of two souls and two families. But I'm curious, have you started shopping for your wedding lehenga?
Simran: Oh, Rishi! It's a never-ending task. The choices are endless, and I can't seem to settle on one. Everything looks stunning, and I can't decide which one will make me feel like a queen on my special day.
Rishi: Don't worry, Simran. You will look like a queen in any attire. Just choose the one that feels right and reflects your personality.
Simran: That's so sweet of you to say, Rishi. Tum bhi na, always know how to make me smile.
Rishi: Well, Simran, you bring out the best in me. Talking to you always brings a smile to my face.
Simran: Aww, Rishi! That's so adorable. You know, tum bhi not bad ho! Such a caring and understanding person.
Rishi: Thanks, Simran. Tumhari tarif sunke mere chehre pe badi si muskurahat aa gayi.
Simran: Rishi, tum bhi na, always flirting with your shayaris! But I must admit, your smile is quite charming.
Rishi: Well, Simran, only you have the power to bring that smile out. And you look even more beautiful when you blush.
Simran: Stop it, Rishi! You know how to make a girl go weak in the knees. Tum bhi na, such a charmer!
Rishi: That's just a glimpse of what you can expect in our future together, Simran. Saath mein, we will create beautiful moments like these.
Simran: Rishi, shayad tum sahi ho. I can imagine a beautiful future with you, filled with love and laughter.
Rishi: Then let's make it happen, Simran. Let's write our own love story, starting from this big Indian wedding.
Simran: Rishi, I would love that. Tum mere saath ho, toh I know everything will be perfect.
Rishi: Together, Simran, we will conquer all the challenges and create a wedding that will be the talk of the town. And most importantly, we will have our happily ever after.
Simran: Rishi, I can't wait to begin this new chapter of our lives together. I love you.
Rishi: I love you too, Simran. Getting married will be the best decision of our lives.
