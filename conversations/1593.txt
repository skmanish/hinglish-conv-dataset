Rohan: Hey Priya, Delhi traffic is such a nightmare, isn't it?
Priya: Absolutely, Rohan! It's like we spend our lives stuck in traffic here.
Rohan: I know, right? It takes forever to get anywhere in this city.
Priya: Tell me about it! I get so tired of sitting in the car for hours.
Rohan: Sometimes I wish I could just fly over the traffic and teleport to my destination.
Priya: Haha, that would be amazing! We could avoid all this chaos.
Rohan: Absolutely! And just imagine the extra time we would have for late-night drives and stargazing.
Priya: Wow, that sounds so romantic, Rohan. Late-night drives and stargazing under the Delhi sky.
Rohan: It could be a perfect way to escape the traffic and enjoy each other's company.
Priya: That's true. We could have deep conversations, laugh together, and create beautiful memories.
Rohan: I can already picture it, Priya. You in the front seat, your smile lighting up the night.
Priya: And you, playing our favorite songs, making every moment unforgettable.
Rohan: It sounds like a dream come true, Priya. Being with you in the silence of the night, away from the hustle and bustle.
Priya: I feel the same way, Rohan. Just being with you makes even the traffic seem bearable.
Rohan: You have a way of turning every situation into something special, Priya. You're my silver lining in the chaos of Delhi.
Priya: And you, Rohan, you bring joy to even the most irritating moments. You make everything worthwhile.
Rohan: The traffic might be a never-ending battle, but every second I spend with you makes it all worth it.
Priya: That's so sweet, Rohan. I didn't expect us complaining about traffic would lead to such a beautiful conversation.
Rohan: Sometimes, it's the simplest things that bring us closer, Priya. Even the chaos of Delhi traffic can't stop our connection.
Priya: That's true, Rohan. It's moments like these that make me realize how lucky I am to have you in my life.
Rohan: And I am the luckiest guy to have you by my side, Priya. I cherish every moment we spend together.
Priya: Rohan, you always know how to make me feel special. I'm so grateful to have you.
