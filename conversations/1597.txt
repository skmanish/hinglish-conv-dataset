Rohan: Hey Simran, how are you? Can you help me with something?
Simran: Hey Rohan, I'm good. Of course, I can help you. What do you need?
Rohan: I'm new to this area. I'm looking for the famous park everyone talks about. Can you give me directions?
Simran: Oh, you mean "Jawaharlal Nehru Park"?
Rohan: Yes, that one! How can I reach there?
Simran: Well, do you know the way to the main market?
Rohan: No, I'm not familiar with the area yet. Could you tell me how to get there?
Simran: Okay, so from here, take a right from the traffic signal and keep going straight till you spot a big bookshop.
Rohan: Got it. Take a right at the bookshop, right?
Simran: Exactly! Then, follow that road until you see the famous ice cream parlor.
Rohan: Ice cream parlor? That sounds tempting! But okay, then what?
Simran: Once you reach the ice cream parlor, turn left, and walk straight. You'll find the park entrance on your right.
Rohan: Perfect! Thanks, Simran. You've been a lifesaver.
Simran: You're welcome, Rohan. Anytime. Are you planning to go there alone?
Rohan: Well, I was thinking if you'd like to join me. We can explore the park together.
Simran: That sounds like fun! I'd love to come along.
Rohan: Great! How about we meet near the park entrance in an hour?
Simran: Sounds good, Rohan. I'm excited. By the way, have you been to this park before?
Rohan: No, this will be my first time. I heard it's a beautiful place.
Simran: Oh, it definitely is! They have a lovely rose garden, a boating lake, and even a small zoo.
Rohan: Wow, that sounds amazing. I'm even more excited now.
Simran: I'm sure we'll have a great time exploring the park together, Rohan.
Rohan: I'm really looking forward to it, Simran. And who knows, maybe this park visit will be the start of something special between us.
Simran: You never know, Rohan. Let's see where this park takes us.
Rohan: Absolutely, Simran. See you soon!
