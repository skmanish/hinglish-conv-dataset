Rahul: Hey Simran, aaj kal we've been bade busy with our studies, na?
Simran: Haan yaar, exams are approaching and I can't wait for them to get over. Kitna pressure hota hai yeh exams se!
Rahul: True yaar, but you know what, sometimes I feel like we miss out on a lot of things because humare yahaan itna focus on studies hota hai.
Simran: Haha, you mean like the parties and fun that international teens enjoy?
Rahul: Haan, exactly! I mean, I see pictures and videos of my cousin studying abroad and itna maza karte hai woh. They have such a different lifestyle!
Simran: I agree, yaar. Lekin hum toh maximum time books ke saath spend karte hai. Accha, tell me one thing, what do you think about casual dating culture abroad?
Rahul: Well, I think it's a personal choice, but we Indians tend to take relationships more seriously, right? I mean, not that dating is wrong, lekin I feel like we value emotional connections more.
Simran: Absolutely, Rahul. I appreciate that about our culture. It's nice to know that Indian teens are more focused on building meaningful relationships rather than just casual dating.
Rahul: Exactly! And if you ask me personally, I would choose the Indian approach over casual dating any day. It's just something about the love and commitment that attracts me.
Simran: I couldn't agree more, Rahul. Our culture teaches us to value our relationships and respect them. It's important to have that emotional connection and trust.
Rahul: Tum bilkul sahi keh rahi ho, Simran. Indian teenagers ka mindset waise hi alag hota hai. We are more grounded and attached to our roots. That's what sets us apart!
Simran: So true, Rahul. Our culture defines us, and we should be proud of it. I feel like these cultural differences make us unique and special.
Rahul: Absolutely, Simran. Let's never forget our values and stay true to ourselves. By the way, you're looking really beautiful today.
Simran: Thank you, Rahul. That's really sweet of you to say. Tum bhi achhe lag rahe ho! 
Rahul: Aww, thank you, Simran! Tumhare saath itna baat karke mujhe bahut khushi ho rahi hai. Tum mere liye khaas ho.
Simran: You know what, Rahul? Tum bhi mere liye khaas ho. Tumhari baatein sunke mera dil khush ho jaata hai.
Rahul: Sach? Toh kya hum dono aage bhi is khushiyon wale safar ko saath mein ek naya mod de sakte hai?
Simran: Rahul, main bhi yehi chahti hu. I would love to explore this beautiful journey with you. 
Rahul: That's amazing to hear, Simran. Chalo, let's make beautiful memories together and cherish the cultural values we hold dear.
Simran: Haan, Rahul. Hum saath mein hamesha khush rahenge, aur apne cultural differences ko ek dusre ke liye strength banayenge.
