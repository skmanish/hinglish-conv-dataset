Riya: Hey Rohan, you won't believe what I discovered today!
Rohan: Kya hua Riya? What did you discover?
Riya: I came across this amazing indie Indian artist on YouTube. His name is Prateek Kuhad. His music is so soothing!
Rohan: Prateek Kuhad? Oh yeah, I've heard his songs before. They're really good!
Riya: Tumne suna hai uska latest song? It's called "Kho Gaye Hum Kahan." It's such a beautiful track.
Rohan: Haan, maine suna hai. Uska music aur lyrics dono bahut heartfelt hai. It's been on repeat for me lately.
Riya: Same here! It's like he captures all our emotions in his songs. By the way, do you have any other recommendations?
Rohan: You should check out Ritviz and Naezy. They are some great indie Indian artists too. Ritviz's song "Liggi" is quite popular.
Riya: Oh, I've listened to "Liggi" before! It's such a catchy tune. I can't help but dance to it every time it plays.
Rohan: Haha, even I end up grooving to it. Any other artists you want to share?
Riya: Have you heard of Prabh Deep? His rap songs are on another level! "K I N G" and "G Maane" are fire.
Rohan: Prabh Deep? Yeah, I've heard his tracks. His rap style is quite unique. I'll definitely listen to more of his music.
Riya: That's great! It's always fun discovering new artists and their music taste. It's like we share a connection through these songs.
Rohan: Absolutely, Riya! Music has a way of bringing people closer. I'm glad we have similar interests in indie Indian music.
Riya: Me too, Rohan. It's refreshing to have deep conversations about music rather than just the usual chit-chat.
Rohan: True, Riya. You know, sharing music with someone is like sharing a piece of your soul. It creates a special bond.
Riya: I couldn't agree more, Rohan. Our taste in music says a lot about us and our emotions. It's beautiful to share that with you.
Rohan: Riya, tumse baat karke mujhe ek ajeeb sa sukoon milta hai. I feel like I can be myself around you.
Riya: Rohan, even I feel the same way. Tumhari har baat, tumhara music taste... it all makes me feel so comfortable and happy.
Rohan: Riya, I think I'm falling for you. Tumse baat karke, humara connection, aur teri muskurahat... sab kuch bahut special hai.
Riya: Rohan, I feel the same way. Tum mere liye kuch khaas ban gaye ho. Tumhari har baat meri dil ko chhoo jati hai.
Rohan: Riya, tum mere saath chalegi? Will you be mine?
Riya: Haan, Rohan. Main bhi tumse pyaar karti hoon. I want to be with you.
