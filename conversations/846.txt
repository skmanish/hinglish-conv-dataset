Raj: Hey Simran, did you hear about the new couple in our college? They are getting all the attention these days.
Simran: Oh really? I haven't heard about them yet. Who are they?
Raj: They are Rohan and Natasha. They were good friends since high school, and now they are officially dating.
Simran: Wow, that's great! They must be really into each other. How did they confess their feelings?
Raj: Well, Natasha couldn't keep her feelings hidden anymore, so she mustered up the courage to tell Rohan during a college event.
Simran: That sounds so romantic! What did Rohan say?
Raj: Initially, he was surprised, but then he admitted that he had feelings for her too. They confessed their love and now are inseparable.
Simran: It's so cute when best friends fall in love. I hope their relationship goes smoothly.
Raj: Yeah, I hope so too. But you know, Simran, sometimes relationships that start as friendships are the strongest ones. What do you think?
Simran: You're right, Raj. When you're already friends, there's a certain trust and understanding that forms a strong foundation for a romantic relationship.
Raj: Absolutely, Simran. I've always believed in that. By the way, have you ever had a crush on any of our friends?
Simran: Oh come on, Raj! You know how secretive I am about my feelings. But yeah, I might have had a little crush on someone in the past.
Raj: Oh really? Who is this lucky guy? You can trust me, Simran.
Simran: Well, if I tell you, you have to promise not to tease me about it.
Raj: I promise, Simran. Your secret is safe with me. So, spill the beans!
Simran: Okay, fine. It was you, Raj. I had a crush on you for a long time.
Raj:  Wait, are you serious? I never knew! Why didn't you tell me earlier?
Simran: I was scared, Raj. I didn't want to ruin our friendship if you didn't feel the same way.
Raj: Simran, I've had feelings for you too, but I didn't want to risk our friendship either. Can we give this a chance now?
Simran: Of course, Raj. I'd love to give it a try and see where our feelings take us.
Raj:  I've always enjoyed our conversations and the time we spend together. I can't wait to see what the future holds for us.
Simran: Me too, Raj. Let's make beautiful memories together.
