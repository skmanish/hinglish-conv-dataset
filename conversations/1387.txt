Rohan: Hey Simran, long time no see! How have you been?
Simran: Hi Rohan, I'm doing great! I've been hitting the gym lately. What about you?
Rohan: That's amazing, Simran! I've been into fitness too. Working out has become a part of my routine now.
Simran: That's awesome! What kind of workouts do you do? Any specific exercise you enjoy?
Rohan: I mostly focus on weightlifting and strength training. It gives me a rush of energy and makes me feel powerful. What about you, Simran?
Simran: I enjoy a mix of cardio and yoga. It helps me stay flexible and de-stresses me after a tiring day.
Rohan: That's interesting, Simran! Yoga is something I've been meaning to try. Any tips for a beginner like me?
Simran: Absolutely, Rohan! Start with basic poses like downward dog and child's pose. It'll help you build strength and improve your flexibility gradually.
Rohan: Thanks, Simran! I'll give it a shot. By the way, do you have any fitness goals you're working towards?
Simran: Well, I would love to achieve a toned and fit body. But for me, it's more about being healthy and feeling confident in my own skin. What about you, Rohan?
Rohan: I completely agree, Simran. Feeling healthy and confident is the key. Besides, it's a bonus when you get those head-turning glances, isn't it?
Simran: Oh, come on, Rohan! You're being too cheesy now! But yeah, I won't deny it feels good to be noticed.
Rohan: Haha, can't help it. You're such a fitness inspiration, Simran. I'm glad we have this common interest.
Simran: Thank you, Rohan! It's great to have someone to share fitness experiences with. We should plan a workout session together sometime.
Rohan: I'd love that, Simran! Spending time together while breaking a sweat sounds like a perfect plan to me.
Simran: Great! We can motivate each other and have some fun too. Just let me know when you're free, and we'll hit the gym together.
Rohan: Absolutely, Simran! I can't wait for our gym date. You're going to be my new workout buddy.
Simran: I am looking forward to it too, Rohan. I have a feeling we're going to make each other's fitness journeys even more exciting.
Rohan: I couldn't agree more, Simran! We'll be unstoppable together, both in and out of the gym.
Simran: Who knows, maybe our fitness bond will lead to something more than just workouts.
