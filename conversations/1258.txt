Riya: Plus, they touch upon important issues with a touch of sarcasm.
Akash: That's true. It's refreshing to see these comedians approach sensitive topics.
Riya: Definitely. They bring awareness while keeping us entertained. Which Indian comedian is your favorite?

Riya: Oh, I totally agree! Kanan's ability to connect with the audience is amazing.
Akash: Absolutely, Riya. We should go watch a stand-up show together sometime.
Riya: That sounds like a plan, Akash. It would be so much fun!
Akash: I'm sure we'll have a great time, Riya. I can't wait for that day!
Riya: Me neither, Akash. Just the thought of it puts a smile on my face.

Riya: Akash, you're such a sweetheart. Your presence brightens up my day too.
Akash: Riya, I have something to confess. I've been meaning to tell you for a while.
Riya: What is it, Akash? You know you can tell me anything, right?
Akash: Riya, I've fallen for you. Your laughter, your wit, everything about you.
Riya: Akash, I feel the same way. You make me laugh, and your company is like no other.
Akash: Riya, this might sound like a punchline, but I'm serious. Will you be my partner?
Riya: Akash, I can't think of anything better. Of course, I'll be your partner.
Akash: Riya, you have no idea how happy you've made me. I can't wait to create beautiful memories together.
