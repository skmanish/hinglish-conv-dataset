Rohan: Hey Simran, kaise ho? Long time no see!
Simran: Hey Rohan! Main theek hu, tum kaise ho? Haan, bilkul, bahut din hogaye mile hue.
Rohan: Arey yaar, I've been so caught up with these school projects and assignments. It's driving me crazy!
Simran: Haan, pata hai! Even I'm drowning in all this work. These group projects are so tricky, na?
Rohan: Haan yaar, group dynamics can be such a challenge. Koi na koi toh humesha sabko tension deta hai!
Simran: True! Kabhi group members assignment time par kaam nahi karte hai, last minute mein sab par tension aa jaati hai.
Rohan: Absolutely! Aur phir whole night jagte rehna padta hai, trying to fit all the pieces together.
Simran: Haha, sahi kaha! But you know, working together can also be fun sometimes. Like when we all brainstorm ideas and crack jokes in between.
Rohan: Oh ho, Simran, aise toh tumhara group lucky hai! At least you get to enjoy while working.
Simran: Haan, maybe we should plan something fun for our group too. Like a pizza party after we finish this project, what do you think?
Rohan: That's a great idea, Simran! It would definitely motivate everyone to work harder and end the project on a high note.
Simran: Haan, we can have some friendly competition too. Let's see which group finishes first and then enjoy the party together.
Rohan: Sounds like a deal, Simran! I can't wait to see your group's project, I'm sure it will be amazing.
Simran: Well, I can't wait to see yours too, Rohan. Let's make this project memorable, together.
Rohan: Absolutely, Simran. I'm glad we're in the same class and can work on projects like these. It brings us closer, doesn't it?
Simran:  Haan, it definitely does. Who knew school projects could lead to such special moments?
Rohan:  You're right, Simran. Life has its own way of surprising us. I'm grateful for this moment, talking and planning with you.
Simran: Me too, Rohan. It feels nice to have someone like you by my side, even during the stressful times. You make everything better.
Rohan:  You know, Simran, it's not just about the projects. I enjoy being with you, the way you laugh, your smartness, everything.
Simran:  Rohan, you're too sweet. I feel the same way about you. You make the boring school days so much brighter.
Rohan:  Simran, can I be honest? I've started to develop feelings for you. I want to be more than just project partners.
Simran:  Rohan, you don't even have to ask. I've been feeling the same way too. Let's give it a chance, and see where this takes us.
Rohan:  I couldn't be happier, Simran. You mean the world to me.
Simran:  And you to me, Rohan. Let's make beautiful memories together, starting from this moment.
