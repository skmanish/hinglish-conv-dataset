Riya: Hey Rohit! Kaise ho? Any recommendations for good Indian authors and books?
Rohit: Hey Riya! Mai bilkul theek hu. Well, have you read "The White Tiger" by Aravind Adiga?
Riya: Haan, padh liya tha. Laga mujhe bahut realistic aur thought-provoking book hai. Koi aur achi book ho toh batana.
Rohit: Ek aur recommendation hai - "The God of Small Things" by Arundhati Roy. Bohot deep storyline hai, emotions ka rang bharta hai.
Riya: Aww, sounds interesting! I'll definitely add it to my reading list. By the way, have you read any Chetan Bhagat novels?
Rohit: Haan, kuch novels padhe hai, but I prefer other authors' books over his. What about you?
Riya: Same here! His writing style feels a bit too commercial for my taste. I like authors who bring something unique to the table.
Rohit: Absolutely, Riya! Have you explored Ruskin Bond's works? His stories are captivating, especially for nature lovers.
Riya: Oh yes, I love Ruskin Bond's stories! The way he brings out the beauty of the hills and valleys is mesmerizing.
Rohit: So true! There's something magical about his writing that transports you to those serene places. Hey, have you read "The Palace of Illusions" by Chitra Banerjee Divakaruni?
Riya: No, I haven't. What's it about?
Rohit: It's a retelling of the Mahabharata from Draupadi's perspective. A blend of history, mythology, and feminism. It's a must-read!
Riya: Wow, that sounds intriguing! I'm always up for stories that provide a fresh perspective. Thanks for the suggestion, Rohit.
Rohit: Anytime, Riya. You know, I enjoy discussing books with you. It's refreshing to connect with someone who appreciates Indian authors.
Riya: I feel the same, Rohit. It's great to have intellectual conversations with you. We have such similar tastes in books.
Rohit: It's like we're on the same wavelength, Riya. I enjoy these conversations, and I'd love to continue exploring new authors and books with you.
Riya: That sounds amazing, Rohit. Let's plan to visit a bookstore soon and discover some hidden gems together.
Rohit: I'd love that, Riya. Exploring books and getting lost in their worlds with you sounds like a perfect date to me.
Riya:  Well, then it's a date, Rohit. Looking forward to our bookstore adventure and many more conversations like this.
Rohit: Me too, Riya. See you soon.
