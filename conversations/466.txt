Ravi: Hey, Aisha! Kya haal hai? Long time, no see!
Aisha: Hey, Ravi! Haan, I've been busy with work. Tum batao, everything okay?
Ravi: Sab theek hai, bas thoda kaam stress ho gaya hai. By the way, have you noticed how social media is changing news these days?
Aisha: Haan, bilkul! Social media has become a powerful platform for news dissemination. Aur log ajkal zyada social media pe news padh rahe hai.
Ravi: Absolutely! Yehi toh maine socha hai. Earlier, news channels and newspapers had a monopoly, but now anyone can share news and opinions on social media.
Aisha: True that! Par kya ye sab news authentic hoti hai? Social media pe fake news aur rumors toh bahut phelte hai.
Ravi: Haan, ye ek valid concern hai. It's important for us to verify the news before we believe and share it. We need to be media literate.
Aisha: Absolutely, Ravi! Media literacy is crucial to tackle misinformation. Aur journalists ko bhi responsible hona chahiye, they should fact-check before they report.
Ravi: Sahi baat hai! But sometimes, social media helps in exposing the truth and bringing important news to the forefront.
Aisha: Haan, bilkul! Social media has given a voice to the common man. It has played a significant role in raising awareness about many social issues.
Ravi: You're right, Aisha. It's fascinating how social media has empowered citizens and created a space for dialogue.
Aisha: Indeed, Ravi. Aur ye hi hume aage badhne ke liye motivate karta hai. We should use social media responsibly to bring positive change.
