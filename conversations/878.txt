Raj: Hey Priya, Diwali is just around the corner. What are your plans for the festival?
Priya: Hi Raj! I am super excited for Diwali. I have planned to decorate my house with diyas and rangoli. How about you?
Raj: That sounds amazing, Priya! I am planning to burst some crackers with my friends and have a delicious feast with my family. Are you joining in the fireworks?
Priya: Yes, I love watching the colorful fireworks light up the sky! I can't wait to see the stunning display this year with you. What's your favorite firework?
Raj: Oh, I absolutely love the grand finale that showers the sky with bright sparkles. It's mesmerizing. Priya, do you have a favorite sweet to enjoy during Diwali?
Priya: Raj, my favorite is definitely the mouthwatering gulab jamun. Its syrupy goodness always makes my taste buds dance with joy. What about you?
Raj: Gulab jamun is delicious! But I have a soft spot for the crispy jalebis. Their sugary crunch brings so much happiness. Priya, do you believe in exchanging gifts during Diwali?
Priya: Absolutely, Raj! The joy of giving and receiving gifts is special. It's a wonderful way to spread happiness and love. What kind of gift would you like to receive this Diwali?
Raj: Well, Priya, the best gift would be spending quality time with you. Your company always brightens my day. What about you? Any special gift on your wishlist?
Priya: Raj, I couldn't agree more. Your company means everything to me too. And if I were to ask for a gift, it would be a beautiful memory with you, something that makes me smile whenever I think about it.
Raj: Priya, you always manage to make my heart skip a beat. I promise to make this Diwali a memorable one for both of us. Would you like to go out for a romantic dinner on Diwali eve?
Priya: Raj, you just know how to make me blush. A romantic dinner sounds perfect! I would love to spend the evening with you, creating cherished memories together.
Raj: Great! I'll make all the arrangements. I can't wait to see the sparkle in your eyes and share the joy of Diwali with you, Priya.
Priya: Raj, your thoughtfulness and enthusiasm are infectious. I'm counting the days until Diwali. It's going to be an incredible festival with you by my side.
