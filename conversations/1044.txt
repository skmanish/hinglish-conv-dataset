Rohan: Hey, Kavya! Kaisi ho? Busy with your college entrance exam preparations?
Kavya: Hey, Rohan! Haan, bilkul. Preparations bahut hectic hai. Tera kaisa chal raha hai?
Rohan: Hmmm, thoda stress hai, but I'm managing. Tere favorite subject kaunsa hai?
Kavya: Mera toh biology ekdum favorite hai. Tu kis subject mein expert hai?
Rohan: Chemistry! Baaki sab ko bhi handle kar leta hoon, but chemistry mere dil ki dhadkan hai. Tu exam anxiety kaise handle karti hai?
Kavya: Hmm, main toh kabhi-kabhi stress ho jati hoon, but meditation and yoga help a lot. Tu kya karta hai exam stress dur karne ke liye?
Rohan: Main guitar bajata hoon! Jab bhi pressure zyada hota hai, music is my escape. Tumhara dream college kaunsa hai?
Kavya: IIT Bombay! Wahan padhna hai. Tu kaunsa college chahata hai?
Rohan: Same pinch! Even I want to get into IIT Bombay. Imagine hum saath padhenge! Time ke saath kya change hua hai tere exam preparation mein?
Kavya: Initially, mujhe bahut dar lagta tha exams se related, but ab confidence badh gaya hai kuch. How about you?
Rohan: Same yaar! Initially, I used to doubt myself a lot, par ab positive vibes aa rahi hai. Mutual motivation factor toh hai hi humara. Kisi difficult topic pe ab tak tu itna struggle kar chuki hai?
Kavya: Physics mein kinematics and calculus mere liye thoda challenging hai. Tumhe koi tough topic mila hai?
Rohan: Organic Chemistry! Woh mujhe thoda dara deta hai but I am trying my best. Aur tere friends kaise prepared hai exams ke liye?
Kavya: Mere sab friends apne-apne tareeke se prepare ho rahe hai. Some are attending coaching classes and some prefer self-study. Aur tere friends?
Rohan: Mujhe kuch friends online classes prefer karte hai and some rely on group studies to clarify doubts. I think every method has its own benefits. Iss stress ke pressure mein, tu kya khaana pasand karti hai?
Kavya: Street food, ice cream, chocolates â€“ uski baat hi kuch aur hai. Tu, kya kya weaknesses hai?
Rohan: Oh toh same pinch! My weakness is also street food and chocolates. We have so much in common! Kavi, tu result ke baad celebrate kaise karegi?
Kavya: I've planned a beach trip with friends. Waise, aapko celebrate karna hai kaise? Kuch special plans?
Rohan: Well, I was thinking of a romantic candlelight dinner with someone special, maybe on a rooftop restaurant. Kya tujhe laga humara conversation aaj kaafi flirty ho gaya hai? 
Kavya: Hmm, shayad thoda sa. Par mujhe toh pasand aaya, kya tum waisa hi insaan ho off-screen bhi? 
Rohan: Woh toh time hi batayega, Kavya. But I wouldn't mind exploring this connection with you. Shall we meet up once exams are over?
Kavya: Definitely, Rohan! Abhi toh exams ke liye focus karna zaruri hai. Lekin uske baad, we'll have some amazing moments together.
