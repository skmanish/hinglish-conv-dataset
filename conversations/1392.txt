Rohit: Hey Simran, Diwali is just around the corner. Are you excited?
Simran: Oh yes, Rohit! Diwali is my favorite festival. I can't wait!
Rohit: Same here! I love the lights, the sweets, and of course, the fireworks.
Simran: Absolutely! Diwali is all about spreading joy and happiness.
Rohit: And it's a time for family get-togethers too. Have you started preparing?
Simran: Yes, I've started cleaning and decorating the house. It's a lot of work!
Rohit: I can imagine. But it's worth it when everything looks beautiful and festive.
Simran: Definitely. I'm planning to make some traditional sweets as well. What about you?
Rohit: Well, I'm not much of a cook, but I'll definitely help in devouring them!
Simran: Haha, you're always the sweet tooth, Rohit. By the way, have you bought new clothes for Diwali?
Rohit: Yes, I have. I love wearing traditional attire during the festival. What about you, Simran?
Simran: Oh, I'm still deciding. But I'll make sure to wear something gorgeous.
Rohit: I'm sure whatever you wear, you'll look stunning, Simran.
Simran: Aww, that's sweet of you to say, Rohit. You always know how to make me smile.
Rohit: Well, seeing you smile brings me joy too. So, any plans for Diwali night?
Simran: I'll be celebrating with my family. We'll have a puja, followed by a grand feast.
Rohit: That sounds amazing. Do you mind if I join you and be a part of your festivities?
Simran: I'd love to have you, Rohit. You're always welcome at my home.
Rohit: Thanks, Simran. Your invitation makes Diwali even more special for me.
Simran: It's going to be a memorable Diwali, that's for sure.
Rohit: I have a feeling it will be, especially if I get to spend it with you.
Simran: Rohit, you never fail to surprise me with your sweetness. I'm really lucky to have you in my life.
Rohit: Simran, you bring brightness into my life, just like the Diwali lights. I'm the lucky one here.
Simran: You really know how to make my heart skip a beat, don't you, Rohit?
Rohit: Only for you, Simran. You're the light of my life, and I'm falling for you more every day.
Simran: Rohit, I feel the same way. Let's embrace this Diwali as the start of something beautiful between us.
Rohit: Simran, I would be honored. Happy Diwali, my love. May our love shine brighter than the Diwali lights.
Simran: Happy Diwali, Rohit. You've already lit up my world, and I can't wait for our journey together.
