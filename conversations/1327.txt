Shruti: Hey, Rohan! Mai bilkul theek hu. Yes, I have been there. The flavors of Punjab are awesome!
Rohan: That's great! I love the rich and spicy flavors of Punjabi food. Par Gujarat ki platter bhi kuch kam nai hai!
Shruti: Haan, Sahi kaha. Gujarati food is so diverse and delicious. I love how they balance sweet, spicy, and tangy flavors.
Rohan: True, Shruti. But what about the famous street food of Mumbai? Vada pav, pav bhaji, sev puri - it's a gastronomic delight!
Shruti: Absolutely, Rohan! Mumbai street food is a class apart. But let's not forget about the aromatic biryanis from Hyderabad.
Rohan: Oh, Hyderabad ki biryani is a treat for the taste buds. The flavors are so rich and the meat is so tender. Simply irresistible!
Shruti: Tujhe pata hai, Lucknow mein Awadhi cuisine bhi famous hai. Their kebabs and biryanis are legendary!
Rohan: Haan, Shruti. Awadhi kebabs are melt-in-the-mouth delicious. By the way, you are making me crave all these yummy dishes!
Shruti: Haha, sorry for making you hungry. But admit it, food is the way to everyone's heart, right?
