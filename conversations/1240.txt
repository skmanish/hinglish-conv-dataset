Pooja: Hi Rahul! Tumne kal ke playlist ko suna?
Rahul: Haan Pooja, maine suna! Tumhare playlist mein kuch amazing songs the! Especially wo indie artist ka gaana... kya naam tha?
Pooja: Oh, tera matlab ‘Aankhon Mein Tera Intezaar Hai’? Yeah, that’s by Prateek Kuhad. He’s such a talented singer-songwriter!
Rahul: Haan wahi! Uska voice aur lyrics, dil ko chhu jate hain. Kya aur artists recommend karogi?

Rahul: Oh, wohi romantic wala gaana! Bahut melodious hai. Tumhe koi recent romantic track batao?
Pooja: Haan, ‘Shayad’ by Arijit Singh from ‘Love Aaj Kal’. Itna soulful hai, aur lyrics bhi dil ko chho jate hain.
