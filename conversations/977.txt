Rahul: Hey, kaisa hai tu Ayesha? Long time no see!
Ayesha: Hey Rahul! Haan yaar, it's been ages. I'm good, wbu?
Rahul: Bas, busy tha college stuff mein. Tu bata, tumhara favorite teacher kaun tha?
Ayesha: Oh, mera favorite teacher Mr. Sharma tha. Unki teaching style bahut cool thi.
Rahul: Haan, I've heard about him. Woh physics padhate the, right?
Ayesha: Haan, physics ka magician tha woh. Humesha experiments aur practicals karate the.
Rahul: Wah! Bohot lucky log jo unki guidance mein padh pate the.
Ayesha: Haan, mujhe bhi woh bohot motivate karte the. Always encouraged us to think out of the box.
Rahul: Waise, mere favorite teacher Miss Verma the. Maths padhati thi woh.
Ayesha: Oh, I see! Woh kaisi thi as a teacher?
Rahul: Unki explanation skills exceptional thi. Sabke concepts clear kar deti thi easily.
Ayesha: Wow, that's impressive! Tumhara favorite subject toh maths hai hi.
Rahul: Haan, mujhe numbers aur formulas samajhna bahut pasand hai.
Ayesha: Waise, tumhara koi unke saath kuch special moment hua tha?
Rahul: Haan, aik baar sabko treat di thi woh. Kyunki hum sabko 100% marks mile the.
Ayesha: That's amazing! Woh treat kahan hui thi?
Rahul: Ek restaurant mein. Unhone hum sabko khub enjoy karne ka mauka diya tha.
Ayesha: Kitna sweet gesture tha uska. Woh sach mein amazing teacher hai.
Rahul: Haan, woh toh hai hi. Waise Ayesha, tu kabhi unse secretly crush toh nahi karti thi?
Ayesha:  Arre, nahi yaar. Just respect aur admiration hai unke liye.
Rahul: Achha, so you're saying there's no chance for competition then? 
Ayesha: Haha, Rahul! You're such a charmer. You never give up, do you?
Rahul: Well, when someone as beautiful and intelligent as you is around, giving up is not an option.
Ayesha:  Smooth talker, huh? But I must say, it's working!
Rahul: Just being honest, Ayesha. Tere bina college ka mahaul thoda adhoora lag raha hai.
Ayesha: Rahul, tu bhi na. Chal, ab dono class mein late hone waale hai. We'll continue this later.
Rahul: Alright, but don't forget we have a date tonight. I want to know more about your favorite teachers.
Ayesha: I won't forget, Mr. Smooth Talker. I'll see you tonight.
