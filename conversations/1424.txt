Rohan: Hey Riya! Summer break is almost here. What are your plans for the holidays?
Riya: Hey Rohan! I am so excited for the summer break. I am planning to visit Goa with my friends. We want to relax on the beach and have loads of fun. What about you?
Rohan: That sounds amazing, Riya! Goa is the perfect place to unwind. I was thinking of going on a road trip to the mountains. I love the serene beauty and adventure of the hills.
Riya: Oh, I absolutely love mountains too! We should plan a trip together sometime. It would be so much fun exploring nature and enjoying the breathtaking views.
Rohan: That's a brilliant idea, Riya! We can plan a trek and camp under the stars. It will be an unforgettable experience. I can't wait to spend quality time with you.
Riya: I would love that, Rohan! It will be a great opportunity for us to get to know each other better. I have heard camping can be so romantic with bonfires and storytelling.
Rohan: Absolutely, Riya! We can share our dreams and aspirations around the bonfire. I have always wanted to travel the world, experience different cultures, and capture those moments through photography.
