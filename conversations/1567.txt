Rohan: Hey Riya, you look stunning today!
Riya: Thank you, Rohan! You're not looking bad yourself. So, what's up?
Rohan: Nothing much, just daydreaming about our next holiday destination in India. Any ideas?
Riya: Oh, I've got plenty! How about the beautiful beaches of Goa?
Rohan: Ah, Goa! Amazing idea. But what about the serene hills of Shimla?
Riya: Shimla is breathtaking, but have you considered the backwaters of Kerala?
Rohan: Kerala has stunning views! But let's not forget about the majestic Taj Mahal in Agra.
Riya: Absolutely, the Taj Mahal is a symbol of love. But have you seen the colorful streets of Jaipur?
Rohan: Jaipur has an incredible cultural kaleidoscope. But what about Udaipur's enchanting lakes?
Riya: Oh, Udaipur is simply magical! But let's not overlook the tranquility of Munnar in Kerala.
Rohan: Munnar's tea gardens are indeed a sight to behold. However, have you ever explored the deserts of Jaisalmer?
Riya: Jaisalmer's golden hues are mesmerizing! But picture yourself in the lush valleys of Manali.
Rohan: Manali's scenic beauty is unforgettable, but what about the adventures awaiting us in Rishikesh?
Riya: Rishikesh's river rafting is thrilling! But the peaceful beaches of Gokarna also have their charm.
Rohan: Gokarna is lovely, but have you ever experienced the spirituality of Varanasi?
Riya: Varanasi is divine, but let's not forget about the vibrant street food scene in Indore.
Rohan: Ah, Indore's food is simply mouthwatering! But how about exploring the royal palaces of Udaipur together?
Riya: That sounds like a dream come true, Rohan! We could have a romantic boat ride in the Lake Pichola too.
Rohan: That's a perfect plan, Riya. We'll make unforgettable memories together.
Riya: Absolutely, Rohan! It's these moments that make holidays truly special.
Rohan: Riya, you make everything special. I'm so lucky to have you in my life.
Riya: And I'm lucky to have you, Rohan. Let's make this holiday unforgettable, just like our love.
Rohan: Forever and always, Riya. You and me, exploring the best of India together. I love you.
Riya: I love you too, Rohan.
