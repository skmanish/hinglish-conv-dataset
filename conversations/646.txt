Radha: Arre yaar, did you hear about Ravi and Simran? They are the latest talk of the town!
Aman: Haan yaar, I heard they are madly in love! Kuch toh chemistry hai dono mein!
Radha: Bilkul hai! Jabse unko dekha hai, they are always together. Lagta hai pyaar ki zor se chadh gayi hai!
Aman: But you know, love in school is always complicated. Pata nahi kitne logon ko takleef hoti hai.
Radha: Right yaar. Woh toh hota hi hai! Par Ravi aur Simran ke case mein, I think they are made for each other.
Aman: Achha? How do you know that? Kuch special dekha hai tumne?
Radha: Haan yaar! They are always supportive of each other, woh selfless pyaar wale gestures and pyaari si nok-jhok, lagta hai perfect jodi hai.
Aman: Pata hai Radha, sometimes I wish mujhe bhi koi aisa special person mil jaaye.
Radha: Don't worry Aman, tumhara bhi time aayega. True love kabhi na kabhi zaroor milega.
Aman: I hope so! Par yeh pyaar na jaane kaisa hai. Kabhi tension hoti hai, kabhi khushi.
Radha: That's true Aman. Love is a rollercoaster ride. Par jab sahi insaan milega, sab theek ho jayega.
Aman: Hmm, you are right. Maybe I need to keep my eyes open and truly understand someone before falling in love.
Radha: Absolutely! Love doesn't happen overnight. It takes time and understanding. But when it happens, it's worth the wait.
Aman: I guess I'll take your advice, Radha. After all, you are the love guru of our group!
Radha: Hahaha, love guru...I like that title! You can always count on me for love advice, Aman.
Aman: Thanks, Radha. You're the best! Aur tere saath baat karke maza aata hai, kuch alag hi hai tu.
Radha: Tum bhi kam nahi ho, Aman. Tumhara sense of humor and intelligence...I find it very attractive.
Aman: Sach? I'm glad that you find me attractive. Tumhe bhi pata hai, tumhare bina mera college life adhuri hai.
Radha: Aww Aman, you are making me blush! Tumhare bina meri days boring ho jati hai. Tum mere best friend ho.
Aman: Radha, I want to be more than just your best friend. Tumhe kya lagta hai, hum dono ke beech kuch ho sakta hai?
Radha: Aman, I've also been feeling something more than friendship between us. Tum mere dil mein kuch alag jagah le chuke ho.
Aman: Sach? That's amazing! So, what do you say? Shall we give this a chance and explore where our feelings take us?
Radha: Haan, Aman! Let's give it a shot. Agar hum saath honge, toh koi bhi pal boring nahi hoga.
Aman: Absolutely, Radha! Ab yeh college romance wali gossip humare apne beech hogi. Together, we'll be the talk of our own college!
Radha: Haha, I'm all in for that, Aman! Tera aisa romantic side dekh kar mujhe aur bhi excited ho raha hai.
Aman: My romantic side is just for you, Radha. Tumhare liye har pair of wings spread karne ko tayyar hoon.
Radha: Aman, you are too sweet! Tum mere sapnon mein bhi aate ho. I can't wait to see what the future holds for us.
Aman: Same here, Radha. Tumhari aankhon mein apna aane wala kal dikh raha hai. Ab ek romantic moment toh banta hai!
Radha: Haha, bilkul banta hai, Aman. Come here, mere superstar!
