Rahul: Hey, Priya! Kya haal hai? I just got back from my trip to the mountains. Kitna suhana tha!
Priya: Hi Rahul! Main thik hoon, thanks. Oh wow, mountains sound amazing! Which ones did you visit?
Rahul: I went to Spiti Valley. It was breathtaking! You should definitely plan a trip there sometime.
Priya: Oh, I've heard a lot about Spiti Valley. It's definitely on my travel wishlist. Did you go hiking there?
Rahul: Haan, I trekked to Chandratal Lake. The views were unbelievable! It felt like being in paradise.
Priya: Wow, that sounds incredible. I love trekking too! By the way, have you been to the beaches in Goa?
Rahul: Haan, Goa is fantastic! The beaches there are out of this world. Have you been to Goa?
Priya: Nahi, not yet. But I'm planning to go soon. Which beach is your favorite?
Rahul: My favorite is Palolem Beach. The sunset there is so romantic, and the shacks serve amazing seafood. You'll love it!
Priya: That sounds perfect, Rahul. I can't wait to experience it myself. So, have you ever been to Rajasthan?
Rahul: Oh, Rajasthan is like a treasure trove of culture and history. I've visited Jaipur and Udaipur. The palaces there are mind-blowing.
Priya: I've always wanted to see the palaces of Udaipur. It must feel like stepping back in time. Any other offbeat places you recommend?
Rahul: Well, have you heard of Khajjiar in Himachal Pradesh? It's often called the "Mini Switzerland of India." The lush green meadows and the beautiful lake make it a must-visit.
Priya: No, I haven't heard of Khajjiar before. But it sounds enchanting! Thanks for the suggestion, Rahul. I'll definitely add it to my list.
Rahul: You're welcome, Priya. I'd love to accompany you on your trip to Khajjiar. It would be amazing to explore such a beautiful place together.
Priya: Really, Rahul? I would love that too. I can't think of a better travel companion than you. Let's plan the trip together!
Rahul: Absolutely, Priya! This trip is going to be unforgettable, just like our journey of finding love. I can't wait to make beautiful memories with you.
Priya: Rahul, you always know the right things to say. I'm so glad we met. Let's make this trip the start of our incredible love story.
