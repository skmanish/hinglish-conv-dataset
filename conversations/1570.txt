Rohan: Hey Simran, yaad hai college ke fests?
Simran: Haan, Rohan. Those were some fantastic times, right?
Rohan: Absolutely! Remember that time when we won first prize in the dance competition?
Simran: Oh yes, that was incredible! I can't forget how we nailed those dance moves.
Rohan: And how everyone cheered for us. It felt like we were on top of the world.
Simran: True! And what about the time we organized the fashion show together?
Rohan: Oh man, I still can't believe we pulled that off. The crowd went crazy.
Simran: It was all thanks to your great sense of style and my event management skills.
Rohan: We made a great team, didn't we? We brought so much energy to the fests.
Simran: Absolutely, Rohan. It's these memories that make me miss those days so much.
Rohan: I feel the same way, Simran. College fests were always so full of excitement.
Simran: You know what else I miss? The late-night jamming sessions we had with our friends.
Rohan: Oh yes, those were the best. Playing the guitar and singing along, creating memories.
Simran: And that time we performed on stage together? I'll never forget the look on your face.
Rohan: You mean when I completely forgot the lyrics? You were my savior, Simran.
Simran: Haha, yes! I jumped in and sang with you, saving the day. We laughed about that for weeks.
Rohan: You've always been there for me, Simran. You're my rock, my support.
Simran: And you've always been my inspiration, Rohan. Your passion for everything you do is amazing.
Rohan: Thank you, Simran. You bring out the best in me. You make me want to be a better person.
Simran: That's incredibly sweet, Rohan. You have no idea how much you mean to me.
Rohan: Simran, I have something to confess. These college fest memories have brought us closer, and I can't deny my feelings for you anymore.
Simran: Oh, Rohan! I feel the same way. These memories have made me realize how much I care about you.
Rohan: Simran, will you be my partner for the rest of our lives? Will you be my forever dance partner?
Simran: Yes, Rohan! I would love nothing more than to be by your side always. Let's create many more beautiful memories together.
