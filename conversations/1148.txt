Rahul: Hi Priya, kitni der se wait kar raha tha main! Kaisi ho?
Priya: Hey Rahul, main bhi tumse milne ke liye excited thi. Main theek hoon, aur tum?
Rahul: I'm good too. So, I heard you went to a CBSE school, right?
Priya: Haan, main CBSE board se padhi hoon. Mujhe laga acha foundation provide kiya hai.
Rahul: Oh really? Mera toh experience ICSE board ke saath bahut accha raha.
Priya: ICSE? Seriously? Tumhe toh CBSE hi pasand honi chahiye thi.
Rahul: Nahi yaar, ICSE ne mujhe practical knowledge aur creativity ke liye encourage kiya. 
Priya: Lekin CBSE ne mujhe analytical skills aur theoretical concepts sikhaye.
Rahul: I agree, CBSE focuses more on theory, but I believe practical application is equally important.
Priya: Haan, par practical skills toh hum college mein bhi gain kar sakte hain.
Rahul: Sahi baat hai, par mere parents ko practical skills ka bhi importance samjhaana tha.
Priya: Parents ka influence is always there, but overall kya difference hai?
Rahul: ICSE boards have a vast syllabus and focus on all subjects equally, while CBSE is more streamlined.
Priya: Haan, par CBSE students have an edge in competitive exams.
Rahul: True, but ICSE students develop better language and communication skills.
Priya: Well, communication skills can be improved outside the board as well.
Rahul: Absolutely, but my experience with ICSE helped me excel in public speaking.
Priya: That's impressive! Main bhi apni communication skills improve karne ki koshish kar rahi hoon.
Rahul: You're doing a great job, Priya. Tumhe shayad koi debate competition join karna chahiye.
Priya: Tumhare sath debate karne mein mazaa aayega. Kabhi try karenge?
Rahul: Zaroor Priya, any topic you have in mind for our first debate together?
Priya: Hmm, let's debate on whether love is stronger than friendship.
Rahul: Interesting choice! Lekin pehle mujhe ye pata lagana hoga ki tumhare pyaar mein kitna dum hai. 
Priya: Accha? Aur kaise?
Rahul: Ek minute, dekho mujhe dil se tumhe kya kehna hai. Priya, tum mere liye sab kuch ho. Main tumse bahut pyaar karta hoon.
Priya: Rahul, mujhe bhi tumse pyaar hai. Tum mere liye special ho.
Rahul: I'm glad to hear that, Priya. Yeh debate aur baki sab baatein baad mein, abhi bas tumhare saath woh special moment enjoy karne ka time hai.
