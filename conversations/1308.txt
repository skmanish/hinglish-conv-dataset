Rohan: Hey Riya! Yaad hai humare school ke annual days? Kitne mast din the na?
Riya: Haan, yaad hai mujhe. Har saal us din main kitna excited hoti thi. Woh cultural performances aur competitions, sab yaad hai.
Rohan: Haan, tab hum log kitna practice karte the na? Especially wo group dance, it was so much fun!
Riya: Haha, bilkul yaad hai. Woh college ke volunteers ban kar humne woh dance sikha tha, remember? It was a challenge, but we nailed it.
Rohan: Haan, yaar. Aur woh painting competition, you were always so talented at it. Third prize tera hi tha last year, remember?
Riya: Haha, haan yaad hai. Woh ek unforgettable moment tha. Tum bhi toh guitar performance ke liye famous the na? Kitne logon ko entertain kiya tha tumne.
Rohan: Arey, flattery bandh karo madam. You were the star performer, har saal tumhe stage pe dekh ke dil garden garden ho jaata tha.
Riya: Stop it, Rohan! Tum bhi toh annual fashion show mein super stylish entry lete the. Girls tumhe dekh ke flat ho jaati thi.
Rohan: Acha? That's news to me! But you know, in the annual plays, we used to make the best jodi on stage. Hum toh famous pair the, remember Romeo-Juliet?
Riya: Haha, haan yaad hai. We had amazing chemistry on stage. Woh Romeo Juliet ki chemistry off stage bhi kuchh kam nahi thi, right?
Rohan: Riya, tum bhi na... You always manage to make me blush. But seriously, those school annual days were some of the best times of my life.
Riya: Same here, Rohan. They were the most memorable days. I miss those fun-filled moments we had together.
Rohan: Riya, ab kyun miss kar rahe ho? Hum toh ab bhi saath hai, zindagi ke har scene ko ek saath jee sakte hai.
Riya: Aww, Rohan.Your words always make my heart skip a beat. You're right, we can create new memories together.
Rohan: Riya, main tumse kuchh kehna chahta hoon...
Riya: Hmmm, kya kehna chahte ho Rohan?
Rohan: Riya, tum meri dil ki rani ho. Tumse pyaar ho gaya hai mujhe. Will you be my girlfriend?
Riya: Rohan, mujhe bhi tumse bahut pyaar hai. Yes, I will be your girlfriend.
