Rohan: Hey Alisha, aaj mera dil bada khush hai. I just went street shopping and got the best deals ever!
Alisha: Wow, lucky you! Street shopping is always so much fun na? Kya kya liya aaj tu ne?
Rohan: Haan yaar, itna saara saman liya, shirts, jeans, accessories, sab kuch. Aur sab itna saste mein mila, I saved so much money.
Alisha: That's awesome, yaar! Street shopping mein secret hai, bargaining skills. Tu ne kitna bargain kiya?
Rohan: Alisha, tu toh jaanti hai, meri bargaining skills top-notch hai! Main toh sab se ekdum kam daam pe kharida hoon.
Alisha: Haha, you're an expert then! Tumhara favorite shopping spot konsa hai street shopping ke liye?
Rohan: Mera favorite spot toh hill road hai, wahan pe saare trendy kapde milte hai. Kya tum wahaan gayi ho kabhi?
Alisha: Haan, gayi thi ek baar, but I usually prefer Colaba Causeway. Wahaan pe bhi bahut options hai aur prices are reasonable.
Rohan: Ohh, Colaba Causeway toh bada famous hai! I should check it out sometime. By the way, tere liye kuch le aaya hoon.
Alisha: Kya? Really? Awww, you're so sweet! Kya hai woh?
Rohan: Surprise hai, lekin tu pehle ghar chal aur milna. Phir tujhe dikhaunga. You have to wait till then, Miss Curiosity Queen!
Alisha: Haha, okay okay, main ghar chali, but ab tujhe mujhe wait karna padega. Jaldi aa jaana, can't wait to see the surprise.
Rohan: Don't worry, I'll be there as soon as possible. By the way, you know, tumne mujhe bola nahi, aaj tum bohot pretty lag rahi ho.
Alisha: Thanks, Rohan! Tumne bhi bahut smart dikh rahe ho. I always enjoy our conversations, it feels so nice to talk to you.
Rohan: Same here, Alisha. Tujhse baat karte karte, I feel like I'm on top of the world. You bring so much joy to my life.
Alisha: That's the sweetest thing anyone has ever said to me, Rohan. Tum mere din ko hamesha khushiyon se bharte ho.
Rohan: Alisha, tu meri zindagi ki khushi hai. Aur aaj, is street shopping wali baat pe, I just realized how much I want you in my life, forever.
