Rohan: Hey Simran, I heard you've been learning to drive. How's it going?
Simran: Haan Rohan, it's been quite a challenge! I can't seem to get the hang of it.
Rohan: Arre, don't worry yaar! Learning to drive can be tough for everyone.
Simran: True, but the traffic in our city is crazy! It gets so overwhelming.
Rohan: Haan, I know what you mean. The honking and constant lane changes can be nerve-wracking.
Simran: Exactly! I feel like I am always on the edge when I'm behind the wheel.
Rohan: But remember, practice makes perfect. Just keep at it, and soon you'll be a pro.
Simran: I hope so! I'm tired of depending on others for rides everywhere.
Rohan: I completely understand. Having your own car gives you so much freedom.
Simran: That's true. Plus, it's a big step towards independence.
Rohan: Absolutely! You'll feel so proud once you get your driver's license.
Simran: I can't wait for that day, Rohan. It'll be such an achievement for me.
Rohan: I'm sure you'll do great, Simran. Just believe in yourself.
Simran: Thanks, Rohan. Your support means a lot to me.
Rohan: Always here for you, Simran. You know that, right?
Simran: I do, Rohan. You've always been there for me, in good times and bad.
Rohan: And I always will be. So, when are you planning to take the driving test?
Simran: I'm thinking of booking it next week. I hope I pass on the first try.
Rohan: I have complete faith in your abilities, Simran. You'll nail it!
Simran: I hope you're right, Rohan. Your confidence in me gives me strength.
Rohan: Trust me, Simran, you're a quick learner. I have no doubt you'll pass with flying colors.
Simran: Thank you for believing in me, Rohan. Your words mean so much to me.
Rohan: You're welcome, Simran. I'll always be your biggest cheerleader.
Simran: That's why I'm so lucky to have you in my life, Rohan. You're always there to support me.
Rohan: And I'm lucky to have you, Simran. You bring so much joy to my life.
Simran: Aww, you're making me blush, Rohan. You always know how to make me smile.
Rohan: Well, your smile is what brightens up my day, Simran.
Simran: That's so sweet of you to say, Rohan. You always know how to say the right things.
Rohan: It comes naturally when I'm talking to someone as amazing as you, Simran.
Simran: Stop it, Rohan! You're making me feel shy now.
Rohan: I can't help it, Simran. You have this effect on me, and I can't resist it.
Simran: You're such a charmer, Rohan. No wonder I always enjoy talking to you.
Rohan: The feeling is mutual, Simran. Talking to you always makes my day.
Simran: I wish we could spend more time together, Rohan. You make everything so much better.
Rohan: Me too, Simran. Hopefully, after you get your license, we can go on long drives together.
Simran: That sounds like a dream come true, Rohan. I can't wait for that day.
Rohan: Until then, let's keep supporting each other through the ups and downs.
Simran: Absolutely, Rohan. You'll always have my support, just like I have yours.
Rohan: And that's what makes us a great team, Simran. We can conquer anything together.
Simran: I'm so grateful for our friendship, Rohan. It's beyond words.
Rohan: Me too, Simran. And who knows, maybe our friendship could turn into something more.
Simran: Are you hinting at something, Rohan?
Rohan: Maybe I am, Simran. I've always had feelings for you.
Simran: Oh, Rohan, I feel the same way. I've been waiting for you to say that.
Rohan: So, what do you say, Simran? Will you be my partner in life, and on those long drives?
Simran: Oh, Rohan, I'd be honored. Yes, I want to be with you, both on the road and in life.
Rohan: That's all I needed to hear, Simran. I can't wait to make beautiful memories with you.
Simran: Likewise, Rohan. Our journey together is about to get even more special.
