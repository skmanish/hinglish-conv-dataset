Rohan: Hey Preeti, kya haal hai? Long time no see!
Preeti: Hey Rohan, sab theek hai! Haan, yaar, it's been ages since we caught up.
Rohan: I know, right? It's been so hectic with this online education and everything. How are you managing?
Preeti: Oh God, tell me about it! It's been so challenging. The connectivity issues, the distractions at home, it's all too much!
Rohan: Absolutely! And don't even get me started on the never ending assignments. Sometimes I feel like I'm drowning in deadlines!
Preeti: Haha, I can totally relate! It's like we're on an endless time-consuming rollercoaster.
Rohan: I wish we could just go back to the good old days when we used to sit in class and listen to the lectures without any worries.
Preeti: I know, right? Those were simpler times. But hey, on the bright side, at least we don't have to wake up early and rush to catch the bus!
Rohan: Haha, true that! Silver linings, I guess. By the way, how are you managing to stay focused during online classes?
Preeti: Well, it's definitely a struggle. But I try to create a dedicated study space at home and keep myself motivated by setting small goals.
Rohan: That's a great strategy! I should probably try that because lately, all I can think about is when this pandemic will be over...
Preeti: Oh, I feel you! We all miss our friends and the classroom banter. But let's stay positive and make the most of this situation!
Rohan: Absolutely! We can't let this pandemic dampen our spirits. Hey, Preeti, do you have any tips for staying motivated and focused?
Preeti: Hmm, well, it helps to have a routine and take short breaks in between study sessions. And of course, having a study buddy like you would make it even better!
Rohan: Aww, that's really sweet of you to say, Preeti! You know, talking to you always brightens up my day.
Preeti: Haha, I'm glad to hear that, Rohan! You never fail to make me smile too. We make a good team, don't we?
Rohan: Absolutely! We're the ultimate study buddies. But you know what I'm realizing? It doesn't have to be just about studies, Preeti.
Preeti: What do you mean, Rohan?
Rohan: Well, maybe we could spend some time together outside of studies. Like maybe go out for a coffee or watch a movie together once this pandemic is over?
Preeti: Rohan, that sounds really nice! I'd love to spend more time with you, not just as study buddies but as friends, or maybe something more...
Rohan: Preeti, I was hoping you'd say that. I've been wanting to confess something for a while now... I really like you, Preeti.
Preeti: Rohan, I... I feel the same way. I've liked you for the longest time. I was just waiting for you to say it!
Rohan: Wow, this feels amazing! I can't believe we kept it a secret for so long. I'm so glad we finally shared our feelings.
Preeti: Me too, Rohan. It feels like a dream come true. I can't wait for this pandemic to be over so we can have our first real date.
Rohan: Preeti, whether it's a virtual date or a real one, I'll cherish every moment with you. Our love story will be one for the books, I promise.
Preeti: Rohan, I can't wait to start this beautiful journey with you. Let's make the most of this online education situation and create beautiful memories together.
Rohan: Absolutely, Preeti. From now on, online education will always remind me of the day we confessed our love.
