Rohan: Hey Simran, wassup? Long time no see! How was your beach holiday?
Simran: Hi Rohan! Oh, it was absolutely fantastic yaar! The sand, sea, and sun were just perfect! What about you? Did you have a good time too?
Rohan: Yeah, Simran, it was awesome! I couldn't get enough of the cool breeze and the beautiful waves. And the best part was the sunset! It was so romantic.
Simran: Oh, I love sunsets! Just imagining it makes me feel so relaxed. Tell me more, Rohan. What did you do there?
Rohan: Well, we played beach volleyball with some new friends we made. I even tried water sports for the first time, Simran! It was thrilling!
Simran: Wow, that sounds amazing! I've always wanted to try water sports. We spent most of our time building sandcastles and strolling along the shore. It was so peaceful.
Rohan: Simran, did you go for a swim in the sea? The water was so clear and inviting. I couldn't resist taking a dip.
Simran: Oh, yes! I did, Rohan. It was a magical feeling, floating in the crystal-clear water. It was like being in a dream, surrounded by the waves.
Rohan: You know, Simran, I can't stop thinking about that moment when we shared an ice cream together by the beach. It felt like time stood still, just you and me.
Simran: That was a very special moment, Rohan. Our laughter and talks were so full of joy. I felt like we were the only two people in the whole world.
Rohan: Simran, I have to tell you something. Being with you on that beach made everything more beautiful. Your smile is like sunshine, lighting up my entire day.
Simran: Rohan, you're making me blush! But I have to admit, being around you also made my holiday unforgettable. You have this way of making everything feel so much more special.
Rohan: Simran, I can't hold it back any longer. I've fallen for you, and I want to be with you, not just on the beach, but in every moment of my life.
Simran: Oh, Rohan... I feel the same way. You've captured my heart, and I want to walk alongside you, hand in hand, on this beautiful journey called life.
Rohan: Simran, you're the sea to my shore, the soft sand beneath my feet. Will you be my partner, my love, now and forever?
Simran: Yes, Rohan, a thousand times yes! I want to be with you, feel the warmth of your love, and create countless memories together. You're my sunshine!
