Rohan: Hey Simran, exam pressure is really getting to me. How are you handling it?
Simran: Oh, Rohan! You know how it is. The expectations from our parents can be overwhelming at times.
Rohan: Absolutely, Simran. Sometimes I feel like they forget we are just teenagers!
Simran: I know, right? It's as if they think these exams will define our entire lives.
Rohan: Exactly! I wish they would understand that there is so much more to us than just these exams.
Simran: Totally agree, Rohan. These exams don't define our intelligence or potential.
Rohan: And the constant comparison with other students just adds to the pressure.
Simran: Absolutely, Rohan. It's so unfair to expect every student to excel in the same way.
Rohan: Yeah, Simran. We all have different strengths and weaknesses.
Simran: I wish our parents would focus on encouraging us rather than pressurizing us.
Rohan: Me too, Simran. It's like they forget that we are already giving our best.
Simran: Exactly. We are studying so hard, and yet they want us to do even better!
Rohan: I just hope they understand that our mental health is equally important.
Simran: Absolutely, Rohan. We need a balance between studies and relaxation.
Rohan: Speaking of relaxation, how about we take a break from studying tonight?
Simran: Oh, Rohan! That sounds tempting. But won't our parents be worried about us?
Rohan: We can just tell them that we need a break from the exam stress, and spend some quality time together.
Simran: Hmm, that might just work. It would be nice to have a little escape from all this pressure.
Rohan: Definitely, Simran. We deserve a little fun amidst all the studying. What do you say?
Simran: Alright, Rohan. Let's do it. A break from the books sounds wonderful.
Rohan: Great, Simran! I'll pick you up at 7 pm. We can have dinner and maybe go for a walk in the park?
Simran: Sounds perfect, Rohan. Thank you for suggesting this. I really need it.
Rohan: Anything for you, Simran. I just want to see you happy and relaxed.
Simran: That's so sweet of you, Rohan. I'm really grateful to have you in my life.
Rohan: The feeling is mutual, Simran. I feel lucky to have you by my side.
Simran: Aw, Rohan! You always know how to make me smile.
Rohan: It's because I love seeing your beautiful smile, Simran. It brightens up my day.
Simran: You're such a charmer, Rohan. No wonder I can't resist you.
Rohan: Well, Simran, I have a confession to make. I can't resist you either.
Simran: Oh, really? And why is that, Mr. Charming?
Rohan: Because you are the most incredible person I've ever met, Simran. I'm falling for you, and I can't help it.
Simran: Rohan, that's the sweetest thing anyone has ever said to me. I'm falling for you too.
Rohan: I'm glad to hear that, Simran. So, will you be my girlfriend?
Simran: Yes, Rohan. I would love to be your girlfriend.
