Riya: Yar, did you read that article about the challenges faced by Indian farmers? It's really heartbreaking, no?
Arjun: Haan yaar, I read it. It's such a tough situation for them. They have to work so hard but still face so many problems.
Riya: I know, right? It's like they are fighting a never-ending battle. And the weather conditions always seem to be against them.
Arjun: Absolutely, Riya. And on top of that, the lack of modern technology and infrastructure makes it even harder for them to compete in this fast-paced world.
Riya: True that, Arjun. It's so unfair that they don't get the support they deserve. The government should do more for them.
Arjun: I completely agree, Riya. They should provide them with better loans, irrigation facilities, and advanced farming techniques.
Riya: Exactly, Arjun. They also need proper storage and transportation facilities. It's so disheartening to see their hard work go to waste because of these problems.
Arjun: You're right, Riya. And we, as citizens, should also be more aware of the challenges they face and support them in any way we can.
Riya: Definitely, Arjun. We should buy local produce and encourage others to do the same. It's the least we can do for our farmers.
Arjun: Absolutely, Riya. In fact, we should also promote organic farming and sustainable practices. That would not only benefit the farmers but also the environment.
Riya: That's a great point, Arjun. We need to ensure the future generations have a healthy and sustainable agricultural system.
Arjun: Absolutely, Riya. The challenges faced by our farmers are complex, and it's important that we all come together to find effective solutions.
Riya: I'm glad we share the same thoughts, Arjun. It shows how well we understand each other.
Arjun: Riya, you have a way of making serious discussions so enjoyable. I'm really lucky to have you as my friend.
Riya: Thank you, Arjun. And you know, you always bring out the best in me too. It's like we complement each other perfectly.
Arjun: Riya, can I be honest with you? These deep conversations we have, they make me feel something more than friendship.
Riya: Arjun, I was just about to say the same thing. I feel a strong connection with you, something that goes beyond friendship.
Arjun: Riya, would it be too forward to say that I have fallen for you?
Riya: Arjun, no it wouldn't be. Because I've fallen for you too. You make every moment special, and I can't imagine my life without you.
Arjun: Riya, you've made me the happiest person. I promise to always be there for you and make you feel loved.
Riya: Arjun, I can't wait to start this beautiful journey with you. We'll support each other just like we discussed supporting our farmers.
Arjun: Riya, let's make a vow to always be each other's strength, just like our farmers are the backbone of our nation.
