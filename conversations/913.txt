Rohan: Hey Neha, what's your take on the evolution of Indian television? 
Neha: Rohan, yaar, I think it has come a long way! From saas-bahu dramas to reality shows, television has definitely changed.
Rohan: Absolutely! It used to be all about family drama, but now we have such diverse content. Shows like Bigg Boss and Roadies have taken over.
Neha: True, but sometimes I feel like it's too much drama. We need more meaningful shows that can make a positive impact.
Rohan: I agree, Neha. Shows like Satyamev Jayate are an excellent example of how television can tackle important social issues.
Neha: That's right, Rohan. It's refreshing to see celebrities using their platform for a good cause, creating awareness and inspiring change.

Rohan: Well, I really enjoyed Mirzapur and Sacred Games. The intense storylines and brilliant acting kept me hooked. What about you, Neha?
Neha: Oh, I can't get enough of Little Things and Kota Factory. These shows capture the essence of everyday life so beautifully.
Rohan: Wow, Neha, seems like we have similar taste. Maybe we should binge-watch a few web series together sometime.
Neha: Haha, sure, Rohan. That sounds like fun. We can order some delicious food and just relax while enjoying some quality content.
