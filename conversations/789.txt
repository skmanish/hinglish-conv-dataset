Riya: Hey Rohan! Did you see Ramesh's wedding pictures? They look amazing!
Rohan: Haan yaar! The bride looked stunning, and the decorations were breathtaking! I wish I could have attended.
Riya: I know, right? The whole ambience was so dreamy. I love how weddings bring out the beauty of traditions.
Rohan: Absolutely! It's a celebration of love and togetherness. I hope to experience it someday too.
Riya: Aww, don't worry. I'm sure you'll find your princess soon. Any special someone catching your eye lately?
Rohan: Well, there is someone, but she doesn't know yet. Should I confess my feelings or wait for the right moment?
Riya: Oh, the suspense! Tell me more about this mystery girl. What makes her so special?
Rohan: She has the most enchanting smile and her eyes sparkle like stars. Being around her makes my heart race.
Riya: That sounds absolutely magical, Rohan! When will you gather the courage to express your feelings to her?
Rohan: I'm taking it slow, Riya. I want to ensure that my feelings are genuine and that she feels comfortable around me too.
Riya: That's really sweet and considerate of you, Rohan. I'm sure she'll be flattered when she finds out about your love.
Rohan: Thank you, Riya. Your support means a lot to me. I hope everything works out positively between us.
Riya: I have a strong feeling it will, Rohan. Love has a funny way of finding its path, just like at Ramesh's wedding.
Rohan: You're right. Love has a way of making everything more beautiful and memorable. Just like that mesmerizing wedding.
Riya: Absolutely! Everything felt so magical, like a fairytale. I can't stop dreaming about my own wedding now.
Rohan: Oh, you have wedding dreams too? Do you have any preferences when it comes to the wedding setup or theme?
Riya: Well, I've always imagined a traditional Indian wedding with vibrant colors, elegant outfits, and lots of dancing.
Rohan: Ah, that sounds delightful. I can already picture us twirling around on the dance floor with joy in our eyes.
Riya: You have quite the imagination, Rohan! But who said dreams can't come true?
Rohan: Indeed, dreams do come true, especially when you have someone special to fulfill them with.
Riya:  Rohan, you always know how to make me feel special.
Rohan: Riya, there's something I've been meaning to tell you. I can't contain it any longer.
Riya: What is it, Rohan? You can tell me anything.
Rohan: Riya, I've fallen deeply in love with you. Will you be my partner in this beautiful journey called life?
Riya:  Oh Rohan, you don't know how long I've been waiting to hear those words. Yes, I will be yours forever.
