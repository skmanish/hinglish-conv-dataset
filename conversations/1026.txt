Rohan: Hi Aisha! Kaisi ho? Long time no see. 
Aisha: Hey Rohan! Haan yaar, I'm good. Missed you too! What's up?
Rohan: Bas yaar, exams have been stressing me out. Tumhe kuch study hacks pata hai?
Aisha: Oh, exams are always tough. Mere paas ek idea hai, main normally notes likhti hoon par phir ek colorful pen se important points highlight kar deti hoon. Tere paas koi hack hai?
Rohan: That sounds interesting! Mera favorite hack hai mind mapping. Diagrams aur flowcharts help a lot to remember things.
Aisha: Oh, I've heard about that. I should give it a try. Tujhe koi note-taking app recommend karna hai?
Rohan: Haan, definitely! Mere liye OneNote kaafi useful raha hai. Google Keep bhi accha hai, but OneNote jyada features deta hai.
Aisha: OneNote? Hmm, main abhi tak Evernote use kar rahi thi. Lekin, phir main bhi try karti hoon OneNote ko.
Rohan: Haan, OneNote best hai. Aur kya tere paas notes organize karne ka koi tip hai?
Aisha: Yeah, I organize my notes using color codes, tabs, and folders. Different subjects ko alag-alag color se highlight karke manage karti hoon.
Rohan: That's smart! Main toh notes ka backup bhi cloud storage mein kar leta hoon. Phir kabhi bhi access kar sakte hain.
Aisha: Smart move, Rohan! Good for revision and peace of mind. So, tere paas aur koi study hack ya tips hai?
Rohan: Well, ek aur trick hai - Pomodoro Technique. 25 minutes focused study, then a 5-minute break. Helps me stay productive.
Aisha: Wah, sounds effective! Main abhi tak breaks ko lekar lazy ho jati thi. I'll give it a try. By the way, tere paas koi favorite subject hai?
Rohan: Haan, I love studying history. The stories and connections always fascinate me. Tujhe koi subject pasand hai?
Aisha: Well, I enjoy literature and English. Novels and poetry give a different perspective on life. Aur Rohan, tere paas koi favorite quote hai?
Rohan: Oh, my favorite quote is "Shoot for the moon. Even if you miss, you'll land among the stars." Always motivates me.
Aisha: Aww, that's so inspiring! By the way, Rohan, tere paas koi secret spot hai jahan tu padhna pasand karta hai?
Rohan: Haan, ek park hai yahan paas. Wahaan baith ke padhna mera favorite tha. Tujhe wahan kabhi le chalun?
Aisha: Wow, woh bahut romantic lag raha hai! Of course, main bhi wahan tujhe join karungi.
Rohan: That would be amazing, Aisha! Let's plan a study date at the park soon.
Aisha: Absolutely, Rohan! I can't wait for our study date. We can share our knowledge and make it a memorable experience.
Rohan: True, Aisha. Ek dusre se padhna aur saath mein time spend karna, it'll be perfect. 
Aisha: I'm looking forward to it, Rohan. Kal se hum apni study hacks aur note-taking apps discuss karte hain, aur phir cute moments banate hain.
Rohan: Definitely, Aisha! Ek saath exam stress ko bhagayenge, aur possibilities ke itne stars paayenge.
