Riya: Hey Rohit, kaisa hai? I heard you have completed your 12th boards. Congrats!
Rohit: Hey Riya! Haan yaar, finally done with boards. Thank you! Tera bhi boards khatam ho gaye kya?
Riya: Haan, abhi thode din pehle hi huye. So, what are your plans now? Which college are you aiming for?
Rohit: Well, I am considering both engineering and medical streams. Confused hoon yaar. Tujhe kya lagta hai?
Riya: Hmm, tough choice indeed. I'm more inclined towards engineering. I have always been interested in technology and computers.
Rohit: That's great! Maybe hum ek hi college me admission le sakte hai. We can pursue our dreams together, what say?
Riya: Sounds like a plan! Itna time saath bitane ka mauka milega and we can help each other out too.
Rohit: Absolutely! Koi problem nahi hoga agar hum different streams ke courses lete hai, right?
Riya: Of course not! Stream toh alag hai, but dosti aur support toh same rahega. Ek doosre ki madad karte rahenge.
Rohit: True, dosti kabhi depend nahi karti hai career choices pe. By the way, koi specific college in mind for engineering?
Riya: Well, I am really interested in getting into the Indian Institute of Technology . It's one of the best engineering colleges in India. What about you?
Rohit: Even IIT is my dream college, Riya! But competition vahaan bahut tough hai. Hopefully, hum dono milke usme admission le paayege.
Riya: Absolutely! Together, we can achieve anything. Imagine the fun we will have while studying and exploring the campus together.
Rohit: Haan yaar, I can't wait for college life. It will be amazing to have you around. Aur tu jaanti hai, mujhe tere saath time spend karne me bahut mazaa aata hai.
Riya: Aww, that's really sweet of you, Rohit. Mujhe bhi tere saath time spend karke bahut khushi milti hai. I'm glad we have similar career aspirations.
Rohit: Riya, main tujhse ek baat share karna chahta hoon. Tumse milne se pehle, mera confidence bohot low tha. Tumne life me positive changes laya hai.
Riya: Sach? I'm glad I could make a difference in your life, Rohit. Tum bhi mere liye special ho, and I am grateful to have you as a friend.
Rohit: Riya, dosti ke saath ab ek aur cheez bhi jodni hai. I really like you, Riya. Will you be my girlfriend?
Riya: Rohit, I had a feeling you might say that. Tum bhi mere liye khaas ho and I have feelings for you too. Yes, I will be your girlfriend.
Rohit: That's amazing, Riya! I'm the luckiest guy to have you in my life. Ab college ke saath saath pyaar bhi badh jayega, what say?
Riya: Absolutely, Rohit! Our college journey will be filled with love and support. Can't wait to create wonderful memories together.
