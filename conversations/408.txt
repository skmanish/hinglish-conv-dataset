Rohan: Hey Aisha, what's up? Long time no see!
Aisha: Hey Rohan! I know right? I've been so busy with my exams. Finally got a break now.
Rohan: I can imagine! Indian exams can be so intense. But it's worth it, right? Our education system is top-notch.
Aisha: Definitely! The competition is tough, but it does prepare us well for the future. What about teens abroad?
Rohan: Well, from what I've heard, their education system is more relaxed. They have fewer exams and more focus on extra-curricular activities.
Aisha: Oh, that sounds so cool! I wish we had more time for hobbies and sports too.
Rohan: Yeah, it would be great. But you know what, I feel like our cultural values are stronger compared to teens abroad.
Aisha: Absolutely! Respect for elders, traditions, and festivals are deeply rooted in us. It's something we should be proud of.
Rohan: Totally agree. Our festivals like Diwali and Holi are so vibrant and full of joy. I doubt they have anything like it abroad.
Aisha: True, those festivals bring our families and communities closer. But don't you think our society can be a bit conservative sometimes?
Rohan: Well, yeah, true. It's a mix of tradition and modernity. But hey, at least we can flirt using our Bollywood lines! "Tum mere ho, mein tumhara hoon."
Aisha: Haha, Rohan, don't start with your cheesy Bollywood lines. But you're right, our movies are a big part of our culture.
Rohan: You got me! Bollywood is so popular overseas too. Our films are all about dance, music, and romance. Just like us!
Aisha: Oh, stop it, Romeo! But you're not entirely wrong. Romance is definitely an integral part of our culture.
Rohan: I'm just saying, we know how to woo our partners in the most romantic way possible. "Tum meri ho gyi, mein tumhe kabse chahta tha."
Aisha: Okay, you're being really cheesy now. But I must admit, our traditional love stories are magical and unique.
Rohan: See, I knew I would make you smile! Indian love stories have that effect on people. We know how to keep the romance alive.
Aisha: Yes, that's one thing I love about our culture. Love is celebrated and cherished, just like our beautiful customs.
Rohan: Absolutely. And I feel fortunate to have you in my life, Aisha. You make every day special.
Aisha: Aw, Rohan, you're too sweet! I feel the same way. You bring so much happiness into my life.
Rohan: You know what, Aisha? Our cultural differences make us even more interesting to each other. We're like a perfect blend.
Aisha: I couldn't agree more, Rohan. Our differences make our relationship stronger and more exciting.
Rohan: So, here's to celebrating our cultural diversity and our love for each other. Cheers, Aisha!
Aisha: Cheers to that, Rohan! I'm so glad I found someone like you who understands and embraces our cultural roots.
