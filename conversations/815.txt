Rahul: Hey Riya! Aaj tujhse baat karne ka mann hai. Tere paas koi ideal aur role model hai?
Riya: Hey, Rahul! Yeah, mujhe Akshay Kumar bahut inspire karte hain. Unki discipline aur dedication dekhkar main bhi motivate hoti hoon. Tumhare koi role model hai?
Rahul: Haan, Shah Rukh Khan mere favourite hai! Unki journey aur unke acting skills mere dil ko choo jate hain. Maine toh unka har movie dekhi hai. 
Riya: Oh, SRK is amazing! Uski on-screen presence se toh koi compete nahi kar sakta. But bahut saare log abhi competition mein hain. Tumhe lagega kaun next superstar banega?
Rahul: Wo toh mushkil hai predict karna, Riya. Lekin Ranveer Singh ke talent aur energy se dhamaal kar raha hai. Uski acting versatility inspires me a lot. Usse competition bahut hai, lekin woh unique hai apna style lekar.
Riya: Absolutely, Ranveer is a powerhouse of talent! Uske performances ke liye woh apne roles mein completely ghul jaate hain. But what about women, Rahul? Any female role model who inspires you?
Rahul: Mujhe Deepika Padukone bahut pasand hai. Unki strength aur determination mujhe inspire karti hai. She has broken stereotypes and made her mark in Bollywood. Apne career mein success ke saath-saath, she has been vocal about mental health issues and women empowerment. I really admire her.
Riya: That's so true, Rahul! Deepika is not just a talented actress but also a strong woman. Woh har situation mein apne aap ko saamne rakhti hai. It's amazing to see how she uses her platform for good causes.
Rahul: Haan, woh ek role model hai millennials ke liye. Aur ek baat, Riya... Tumhari smile, she sets the bar high for all the role models out there.
Riya: Aww, thanks Rahul! Tum bhi kuch kamaal ke ho, jo mujhe itna compliment kar rahe ho. Tumhari positivity and intelligence makes you one of my role models.
Rahul: Dil se shukriya, Riya! Tumhari support aur encouragement inspire karte hain mujhe har roz. Kitni special ho tum!
Riya: Rahul, tumne mere din ko khushi se bhara diya hai. Tum ek bahut hi amazing person ho. I'm really lucky to have you in my life.
Rahul: Riya, main bhi bahut khush hoon ki tumne mujhse pyaar kiya hai. Tum meri inspiration ho, meri duniya ho.
Riya: Rahul, tum bhi mere liye bahut khaas ho. I'm falling for you, and I don't want to stop.
Rahul: Riya, yeh pyaar ki feeling hai na? Let's embrace it. Tumhare saath, meri zindagi aur bhi beautiful ho gayi hai.
Riya: Rahul, I can't wait to see where this journey takes us. I love you.
Rahul: I love you too, Riya. Hamesha saath rahenge, inspiration ban ke.
