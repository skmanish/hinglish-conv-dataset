Rohan: Hey Riya, kya chal raha hai? Long time no see!
Riya: Hey Rohan, haan yaar! I've been so caught up with college work. You won't believe what happened yesterday at our canteen.
Rohan: Oh really? Koi naya gossip?
Riya: Haan, you remember Sameer, right? The cute guy from our batch?
Rohan: Haan yaar, woh ladka toh hamesha attention grab karta hai.
Riya: Exactly! So, I heard he was spotted hanging out with Tina, that new girl in our college.
Rohan: Tina? Wohi jo freshers party mein sabko surprise kiya tha?
Riya: Haan, wahi. Looks like Sameer is quite impressed with her. I think something is brewing between them.
Rohan: Interesting! Par abhi tak toh Sameer single tha, isn't it?
Riya: Haan, pata nahi yaar. Shayad koi connection ho gaya hai. You know boys, they can't resist new and exciting girls.
Rohan: True, true. But Tina ki koi pichle college mein bhi connection nahi thi, right?
Riya: Well, I heard she had a little something going on with Akshay, the senior. But that ended quickly.
Rohan: Oh, the drama! Akshay bhi toh bahut famous hai. Boys ka casanova hai woh.
Riya: Sach mein, yaar. But Tina seems different, maybe Sameer is really falling for her.
Rohan: Who knows, love is unpredictable. Par tujhe kya lagta hai, Riya? Should I make a move on someone too?
Riya: Hmm, shayad. Lekin kisse pe? Kisi special girl pe?
Rohan: Well, I was thinking about someone... someone like you, Riya.
Riya:  Really? You've caught my attention, Mr. Flirty.
Rohan:  Oh, I have only just begun, Miss Mysterious. Maybe we should continue this conversation over a cup of coffee?
Riya:  Sure, why not? I'd love to see if your flirty nature extends beyond just conversations.
Rohan:  You'll find out soon enough, Riya. So, what do you say we meet up tomorrow?
Riya: Tomorrow sounds perfect. Let's meet at that cute cafe near our college.
Rohan: Done deal! I can't wait to get to know you better, Riya.
Riya: The feeling is mutual, Rohan. I think it's time we create our own gossip in the friend circle, don't you think?
Rohan: I couldn't agree more, Riya. Let's make this gossip-worthy.
