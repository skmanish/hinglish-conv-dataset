Rohan: Hey Riya, what's up?
Riya: Hey Rohan, just exploring some DIY projects on YouTube. You?
Rohan: Oh, that's cool! I'm into crafts and learning new skills too. What are you working on?
Riya: I'm making a handmade photo frame using recycled materials. How about you?
Rohan: Nice! I just learned how to make a dreamcatcher. It's quite interesting.
Riya: Oh wow, that sounds amazing! Could you teach me how to make one?
Rohan: Of course, Riya! I'd love to show you how it's done. Maybe we can meet up sometime?
Riya: That would be great! Let's plan it for this weekend?
Rohan: Absolutely! I'll bring all the materials needed. By the way, you have any other favorite crafts?
Riya: I'm also interested in paper quilling. It's so satisfying to create beautiful designs with just paper strips.
Rohan: That's awesome. I've seen some stunning quilling artwork. Maybe we can try it together someday?
Riya: Definitely! I'd love to learn from you. What else have you been learning from YouTube lately?
Rohan: Well, I've been watching cooking videos. Trying my hand at some tasty new recipes.
Riya: Oh, that's fantastic! I'm a huge foodie. What's your favorite dish you learned?
Rohan: Recently, I learned to make cheesy garlic bread. It turned out quite delicious!
Riya: Yum, I absolutely love garlic bread! You must teach me that recipe too.
Rohan: We can definitely make it together sometime. I'd love to cook for you, Riya.
Riya: That's so sweet of you, Rohan. By the way, I've also seen videos on learning to play the guitar. It's something I've always wanted to try.
Rohan: Really? That's amazing! I actually play the guitar. Maybe I can give you some beginner lessons?
Riya: Oh, that would be fantastic! I can imagine us jamming together in the future.
Rohan: That's a beautiful thought, Riya. I can't wait for our DIY projects day and all the fun we'll have.
Riya: Me too, Rohan. Spending time with you doing what we love sounds perfect. I'm really looking forward to it.
