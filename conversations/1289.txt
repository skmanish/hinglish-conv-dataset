Raj: Hey Meera, kaisi ho yaar? It's been a long time since we caught up!
Meera: Raj, main bilkul theek hoon! It's great to hear from you after so long. How's everything with you?
Raj: Sab mast chal raha hai yaar. College life is quite a roller coaster ride. By the way, I heard you are studying in Chennai. Kaisa hai wahan ka college culture?
Meera: Haan, Chennai mein padh rahi hun. College culture yahan bada traditional hai. Hum sab roz mandir jaate hai aur sare festivals celebrate karte hai.
Raj: Wow, that sounds fascinating! Yahan Delhi mein toh bada liberal hai college culture. Hum log raat ko parties karte hai, fests organize karte hai. Some of them get pretty wild.
Meera: Haha, Delhi waalo ko toh parties ka shauk hai hi! But yahan Chennai mein bhi cultural fests hote hai. Classical dance, music performances, and debates bhi interesting hote hai.
Raj: Nice! Delhi mein bhi bohot fests hote hai, but more focused on the modern trends and Western music. Humara rock band bhi perform karta hai.
Meera: That sounds amazing, Raj! Ek baar mujhe bhi apne band ka performance dekhna chahiye. Music festival bohot pasand hai mujhe.
Raj: For sure, Meera! Tum bhi aana next time jab hum fest organize karenge. We can hang out and enjoy the music together.
Meera: That sounds like a plan, Raj! By the way, kya tumne South Indian food try kiya hai Chennai mein?
Raj: Haan, yaar! I have tried dosa, idli, and filter coffee. And trust me, I loved it! Wahan ke street food kaunsa pasand hai? Mere liye recommendations do, please.
Meera: Oh, toh Raj ko South Indian khana bhi pasand aaya! You must try the famous filter coffee in Mylapore. And don't miss the Chettinad chicken biryani, it's a must-have here!
Raj: Thanks for the suggestions, Meera! Abhi mujhe aur bhi zyada Chennai ke baare mein jaanna hai. Can you show me around whenever I visit?
Meera: Of course, Raj! I would love to be your tour guide. We'll explore the beaches, visit historical places, and try authentic Chennai food together.
Raj: That sounds amazing, Meera! It's been great catching up with you. You know, yahan baarish ho rahi hai and your voice is making it even more beautiful.
Meera: Raj, you always know how to make me blush! Tu bhi kuch kam nahi, with that charming smile of yours. I can't wait to meet you in person and have these conversations face-to-face.
Raj: Meera, I can't wait either. Yeh virtual conversations are fun, but being together will be a whole new level of excitement.
Meera: Raj, all this college culture talk made me realize that we have a lot in common. I think I'm falling for you, Raj.
Raj: Meera, I've been feeling the same way too. I can't wait to be more than just friends. You're an amazing person, and I'm lucky to have you in my life.
Meera: Raj, let's make this a reality. You're not just an amazing friend, but someone I can see myself falling in love with. I can't wait to be yours.
Raj: Meera, I'm yours and only yours. Let's make beautiful memories together and experience the best of both our college cultures.
