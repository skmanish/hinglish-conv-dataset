Riya: Hey Akash, suna hai you've bought a new phone! Kaisa hai?
Akash: Haan Riya, I recently got the latest iPhone! Ekdam solid hai yaar, performance, camera, sab kuch!
Riya: Wow, mujhe bhi lene ka plan hai, but I'm a little confused. Should I go for the iPhone or the new Samsung Galaxy?
Akash: Arre Riya, iPhone hi lele na! It's totally worth it! Camera quality is amazing, selfies toh next level ho jate hai!
Riya: Achha, but Samsung ka battery backup bahut acha hai, isn't it?
Akash: Haan, woh toh hai, but trust me, once you experience the iPhone, you won't even worry about the battery. It's simply awesome!
Riya: Hmm, iPhone sounds tempting now. But tu kitne ka le liya bhai?
Akash: It cost me around 80,000, but it's totally worth every penny. Trust me, you won't regret it!
Riya: Woah, itna mahenga! Okay, tell me one thing, does it have a fingerprint scanner?
Akash: Haan, Riya, it has Face ID instead of a fingerprint scanner. It scans your face and unlocks the phone, bahut cool feature hai!
Riya: That's amazing! Itna advanced technology hai, I'm impressed! 
Akash: Tujhe impress karne ke liye toh main kuch bhi kar sakta hoon, Riya!
Riya: Oh really, Mr. Charmer? Tell me more about the phone's other features.
Akash: Riya, the phone has a super smooth display, amazing sound quality, and it's water-resistant too! Ekdum perfect hai!
Riya: Wow, now I'm actually getting excited about buying it! But yaar, I also need to save some money for other things.
Akash: Don't worry, Riya. I can help you with that. Maybe we can go shopping together and find some great deals?
Riya: Akash, you're such a sweetheart! Shopping with you sounds like a plan. Maybe we can even have dinner together after our shopping trip?
Akash: Absolutely, Riya! I'd love to spend more time with you. Dinner and more, if you'd like!
Riya: Haha, cheeky! But I would love that too, Akash. I'm looking forward to our shopping date.
Akash: Great! It's a deal then. And who knows, maybe this new iPhone will be witness to some beautiful memories between us!
Riya: I hope so, Akash. Can't wait for our date and all the adventures to come!
