Kunal: Hey Radhika, social media has taken over our lives. It's crazy how much it has impacted news in India, right?
Radhika: Absolutely! It has become an integral part of journalism. News spreads like wildfire on platforms like Twitter and Facebook.
Kunal: True. It's so convenient to stay updated on the go. But sometimes, I feel like rumors and fake news also become viral.
Radhika: Yeah, that's certainly a downside. Journalists have to be cautious about fact-checking and ensuring accurate information is shared.
Kunal: Definitely. And sometimes, social media sensationalizes news, focusing more on clickbait headlines rather than the actual content.
Radhika: That's a valid point, Kunal. It's important for journalists to maintain their credibility and not just chase likes and shares.
Kunal: Absolutely. But on a brighter note, social media also allows for citizen journalism, empowering individuals to report news firsthand.
Radhika: That's true. It has given a voice to ordinary people who can now share their stories and experiences directly with the world.
Kunal: Exactly. And social media has also made news more interactive. People can comment, discuss, and even debate important issues.
Radhika: I agree. It has sparked conversations, bringing different perspectives together and creating a sense of community.
Kunal: By the way, your insights on this topic are quite impressive, Radhika. You really know your stuff.
Radhika: Thank you, Kunal. I've always been interested in journalism and how it's evolving in the digital age.
Kunal: Well, your passion and knowledge are truly captivating, Radhika. It's refreshing to have such stimulating conversations with you.
Radhika: Flattery won't get you anywhere, Kunal. But I must admit, I enjoy discussing these topics with you as well.
Kunal: Haha, I'm not just flattering. I genuinely enjoy our conversations. You have this way of making even serious topics fascinating.
Radhika: Well, I'm glad to hear that. Talking to you is always enlightening and fun.
Kunal: You know, Radhika, we should continue having these discussions over a cup of coffee sometime. It'd be great to dive deeper into topics like this.
Radhika: That sounds like a wonderful idea, Kunal. I'd love to have more intellectual conversations with you over a cup of coffee.
Kunal: Great! Let's make it a date then. How about this Saturday at that new caf√© in town?
Radhika: Sounds perfect, Kunal. I'm looking forward to it.
