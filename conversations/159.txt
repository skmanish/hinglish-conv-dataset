Rohan: Hey Neha! Yaad hai woh din jab hamare parents hume vacation pe le jaate the?
Neha: Haan, yaad hai! Woh Goa wala trip mere liye unforgettable tha. Tumhe kya yaad hai?
Rohan: Mujhe bhi yaad hai, especially woh din jab hum breakfast ke liye hotel ke terrace pe gaye the. Wahan ka view itna breathtaking tha na!
Neha: Haan, woh toh sach mein magical tha. Aur mujhe yaad hai humne wahan sunrise bhi dekhi thi. It was like a dream come true.
Rohan: Waise Neha, tum wahan ka adventure park yaad karte ho? Woh rides aur slides humne kitna enjoy kiya tha!
Neha: Oh haan, us din humne har ride try ki thi. Mere liye woh slide bhi unforgettable tha, jahan hum dono sath mein slide kar rahe the!
Rohan: Haan, woh moment mujhe bhi yaad hai. Tumhari smile, tumhare cheeks pe woh rosy glow... I couldn't take my eyes off you.
Neha: Oh stop it, Rohan! Tum bhi na, flirting pe hamesha pakde jaate ho.
Rohan: Sach kaha Neha, itna special moment tha woh. Tumhare sath time spend karna humesha memorable hota hai.
Neha: Tum bhi mere liye bahut special ho, Rohan. Woh din, woh vacation... hamesha yaad rakhungi.
Rohan: Aur Neha, kya tum yaad karte ho woh din jab hum beach pe walk kar rahe the? Tumhari hand mere hand mein... it felt like we were the only two people in the world.
Neha: Haan Rohan, woh walk mere liye bhi kuch khaas tha. Mere dil ki dhadkan tab se tumhare saath ruk gayi thi.
Rohan: Neha, I have something to tell you. Woh walk, woh slide, woh terrace... I have fallen in love with you, Neha.
Neha: Rohan, even I have been feeling the same. Tum mere dil mein bas gaye ho.
Rohan: This vacation has brought us closer, Neha. I want to make more memories with you, not just from our childhood but for the rest of our lives.
Neha: Rohan, I would love to create endless memories with you, hand in hand. You make every moment magical.
Rohan: Neha, will you be my partner in this journey called life?
Neha: Yes, Rohan! I would be honored to be your partner, your best friend, and your forever love.
