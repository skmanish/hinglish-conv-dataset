Rahul: Hey Priya! Any good Indian authors you've been reading lately?
Priya: Hey Rahul! Yes, I've been totally hooked on Chetan Bhagat's novels. Have you read any of his books?
Rahul: Oh yeah, I've read a few! His stories are always so relatable. But these days, I'm more into Amish Tripathi's books. The way he blends mythology with fiction is incredible.
Priya: Amish Tripathi? I've heard good things about his books, but I haven't had a chance to read any yet. Which one would you recommend?
Rahul: You must start with the "Shiva Trilogy"! The way he introduces Lord Shiva in a contemporary setting is mind-blowing. The first book is "The Immortals of Meluha."
Priya: Sounds intriguing! I'll definitely add it to my reading list. By the way, have you read any novels by Ashwin Sanghi?
Rahul: Oh yes, I have! "The Krishna Key" is a masterpiece. It's a perfect blend of history, mythology, and suspense. You won't be able to put it down!
Priya: That sounds like just the kind of book I love. I'm definitely going to check it out. Thanks for the recommendation, Rahul!
Rahul: My pleasure, Priya! You know, I love talking about books with you. It's so refreshing to have someone who shares my passion for reading.
Priya: I feel the same way, Rahul. It's hard to find people who appreciate good literature these days. It's nice to have someone I can discuss my favorite books with.
Rahul: Absolutely! And I must say, your taste in books is impeccable. It makes me even more intrigued by you.
Priya:  Flattery will get you everywhere, Rahul. But I must say, your book recommendations have definitely piqued my interest. I'd love to explore more books together.
Rahul: That sounds amazing, Priya! We can have our own little book club where we can dive into the world of Indian literature together. It'll be a great way to spend more time with you.
Priya: I'd love that, Rahul! It's wonderful to connect with someone who not only appreciates books but also has captured my heart. 
Rahul:  Priya, you have my heart too. Let's make our book club a special place where our love for literature blossoms alongside our feelings for each other.
Priya:  I couldn't ask for anything more, Rahul. Our journey through words will be filled with love, adventure, and endless romance. I'm eagerly looking forward to it!
