Riya: Hey Rohan! Woah, really? Batao, mujhe bhi details chahiye! I want to glow like never before!
Rohan: Sure Riya, I gotchu! So, I read about this new face mask - it's made with natural ingredients like turmeric and honey. Best part, you can make it at home!
Riya: Oh wow, that sounds interesting! Kaafi convenient hai yaar. Kabse use kar raha hai tu?
Rohan: Haha, abhi ek hafte se try kar raha hoon. Results amazing hai, bilkul fresh and rejuvenated lagta hai chehra!
Riya: Sounds great! Mujhe bhi try karna hai. Aur koi skincare routine tha tere paas?

Rohan: That's awesome, Riya! I've actually been thinking of buying one for myself. Koi suggestions hai kya?
Riya: Definitely, I can share a few online stores with you. Aakhir tere liye kuch bhi!
Rohan: Riya, you're the best! Tum paas ho toh mujhe kisi aur ki jarurat hi nahi hoti hai.
Riya: Awww, Rohan! You always know how to make me smile. By the way, tere paas koi secret skincare weapon hai?
Rohan: Haan hai Riya, I recently found out about the benefits of using aloe vera gel. It's great for hydrating and soothing the skin.
Riya: Sach mein? I've used it before but didn't know about its benefits. Thanks for sharing, Rohan!
Rohan: Anytime, Riya! You know, tere beautiful skin ke secrets share karna is my pleasure.

Riya: Aww, so sweet of you, Rohan! Tum bhi kuch kam nahi ho. Tumhari iss cute si smile pe toh koi bhi fida ho jaye.
Rohan: Riya, tu bhi na! Tumhare compliments se toh mera chehra aur bhi glow kar raha hai.
Riya:  Ab bas bhi karo, Rohan! Tum mujhe hamesha hi hassa dete ho.
Rohan: Riya, mujhe tumhari aankhon mein apna future dikhta hai. Can we meet for coffee, jahan hum aur ghanto tak ye beauty hacks aur skin care routines ke baare mein baat kar sake?
