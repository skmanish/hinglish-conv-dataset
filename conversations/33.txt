Saurabh: Hey Riya, have you started learning to drive yet? 
Riya: Hi Saurabh! Yes, I have. It's quite challenging, but I'm getting the hang of it. How about you? 
Saurabh: That's awesome! Well, I'm still struggling a bit. Parallel parking is my kryptonite. It's so hard to get the angles right. 
Riya: Oh, it's all about practice. I used to be terrible at it too. But trust me, you'll get better with time and experience. 
Saurabh: I hope so. By the way, have you faced any funny incidents while learning to drive? 
Riya: Yes, definitely! Once, I accidentally hit a garbage can while trying to park. Everyone around started laughing, including me! It was embarrassing yet hilarious. 
Saurabh: Haha! I can only imagine. I once mixed up the brake and accelerator pedals. Thankfully, I was in a parking lot and didn't cause any major mishaps. 
Riya: Oh no, that must have been quite nerve-wracking. Don't worry, these things happen to everyone. Just keep practicing and soon you'll be a pro. 
Saurabh: Thanks, Riya. Your encouragement means a lot to me. By the way, have you taken your driving test yet? 
Riya: Not yet, but I have it scheduled for next week. I'm quite nervous about it. 
Saurabh: Don't be nervous, Riya. You've come so far, and I know you'll do great. Just believe in yourself and trust your skills. 
Riya: Thank you, Saurabh. You're always so supportive. I really appreciate it. 
Saurabh: Anytime, Riya. You're an amazing person, and I genuinely want the best for you. Just remember to stay focused and confident during the test. 
Riya: You're making me blush, Saurabh. Your words really mean a lot to me. I'm glad we have such a great bond. 
Saurabh: Riya, our bond keeps growing stronger every day. You bring so much happiness into my life. 
Riya: Saurabh, you're making my heart skip a beat. I feel the same way about you. 
Saurabh: Riya, I have a confession. Whenever I see you, I feel like the luckiest person in the world. 
Riya: Saurabh, you're stealing my heart with your words. You make me feel so special and loved. 
Saurabh: Riya, I can't wait to create more beautiful memories with you. You're the one I want to share my life with. 
Riya: Saurabh, I feel the same way. Let's make those memories together. 
Saurabh: Riya, will you be my partner in this journey called life? 
Riya: Yes, Saurabh, I would be honored to be your partner. I love you. 
Saurabh: I love you too, Riya. This is the beginning of our forever.
