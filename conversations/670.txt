Rohan: Hey Priya, tu kahaan chali? Train se ya car se? 
Priya: Hey Rohan! Main train se aayi. Indian Railways kaafi acchi service deti hai, don't you think?
Rohan: Haan, bilkul! Indian Railways bahut bada network hai. It connects almost all the cities and towns in India. Kabhi socha hai, kitne trains chalti hongi ek din mein? 
Priya: Nahi, pata nahi. Par I can imagine, it must be in lakhs. 
Rohan: Bilkul sahi. Actually, Indian Railways ki network itni badi hai ki India ke tourism industry ke liye bhi kaafi important hai. 
Priya: Haan, sahi kaha. Trains give us a unique way to explore different parts of the country. Aur usme safar karne ka maza hi kuch aur hai. 
Rohan: Absolutely! Aur sabse acchi baat hai ki trains affordable hai. Almost har kisi ki pocket mein fit ho jaati hai. 
Priya: Haan, wohi toh. Travel karne ka experience bhi amazing hota hai. Kitni different cultures aur logon se interact kar sakte hai hum. 
Rohan: Sach hai! Aur kitne sundar jagah se guzar sakte hai train mein. Kuch stations toh bahut iconic hai, like the Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus in Mumbai, right? 
Priya: Haan, CST bahut beautiful hai. And not just the stations, even the train journeys are breathtaking. Especially when you travel through scenic landscapes like the Himalayas or Kerala backwaters. 
Rohan: Oh, you've been to Kerala? Mujhe bhi wahan jaana hai kabhi. It's on my travel bucket list. 
Priya: Same here! Ek baar wahan hum saath jaayenge, wahaan ki natural beauty ke saath trains ka romance bhi experience kar sakte hai. 
Rohan: That sounds like a perfect plan! Train ka romantic ambience, natural beauty, aur hum dono ka company - kya more could we ask for? 
Priya: Absolutely! Wohi toh, train journeys bring people closer, and I'm sure yeh trip hamare liye aur bhi special banega. 
Rohan: I can't wait for that trip, Priya. Tumhari smile aur Indian Railways ka magic, is combination mein kuch magical hai. 
Priya: Awww, thank you, Rohan! Tu bhi mere liye special hai. We are going to make some beautiful memories together, both on and off the train.
