Rohan: Hey, Riya! Long time no see. How was Ayushi's wedding last week? 
Riya: Hi, Rohan! Oh, it was amazing! Ayushi looked stunning in her bridal attire. 
Rohan: I bet she did. Did you catch the baraatis dancing to the latest Bollywood tracks?
Riya: Yes, it was a blast! You should have seen me showing off my killer dance moves too.
Rohan: I wish I was there to witness that. I'm sure you stole the show. 
Riya: Oh, stop flattering me. But yes, it was quite a party. The whole function was so colorful and vibrant.
Rohan: I can only imagine. Tell me, did you get a chance to try out all the delicious food at the reception?
Riya: Absolutely! The food was divine. I couldn't resist going for seconds and thirds. It was a food lover's paradise.
Rohan: I wish I could have joined in. The way you describe it, I feel like I missed out on a gastronomic experience. 
Riya: Well, you definitely did. But I saved some sweets for you in a little takeaway box. Interested? 
Rohan: Really? That's so sweet of you, Riya. You always think about me. Count me in!
Riya: Great! I'll save some for you. So, did you hear about how the couple met? It's quite a cute story.
Rohan: No, I haven't! Do tell me the details. I'm a sucker for love stories.
Riya: Well, they actually met in college through a mutual friend and gradually became inseparable. They were meant to be, you know?
Rohan: That's so adorable! Love stories like these give hope to people like me who are still searching for their happily ever after. 
Riya: Don't worry, Rohan. I'm sure you'll find your perfect match too. Just be patient and keep your eyes open.
Rohan: Thanks for the encouragement, Riya. Speaking of which, have you found your Mr. Right yet?
Riya: Well, let's just say I'm still waiting for that spark. But for now, let's focus on enjoying the memories of Ayushi's perfect wedding.
Rohan: You're right, Riya. Sometimes, it's better to live in the present and cherish these beautiful moments. 
Riya: Exactly. Life is too short to worry about what hasn't happened yet. Let's dance like nobody's watching and make some memories.
Rohan: I couldn't agree more. Riya, would you like to dance with me right now? 
Riya: I would love to, Rohan. Shall we?
