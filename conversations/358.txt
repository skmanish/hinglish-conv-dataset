Riya: Haan Aditya, I have seen a few. But I feel like Indian cinema has come a long way in recent years.
Aditya: Absolutely Riya! The quality of storytelling and production value has improved so much.
Riya: And the performances too! Actors like Ranveer Singh and Alia Bhatt are giving their best in every movie.
Aditya: True, they are bringing so much energy and freshness to the screen. Have you seen Gully Boy?
Riya: Oh my god, Aditya! Ranveer was outstanding in that film. The rap scenes were mind-blowing.
Aditya: I know, right? It was so inspiring to see a story based on street rappers and their struggles.
Riya: Bollywood is finally exploring different genres and telling unique stories. It's a refreshing change.
Aditya: Absolutely! Now we have movies like Andhadhun and Badhaai Ho, which are both entertaining and thought-provoking.
