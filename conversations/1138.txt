Ramesh: Hey Sejal, kaisa hai tu? Long time no talk!
Sejal: Hey Ramesh! Haan yaar, I've been super busy with college and family. Tum kaise ho?
Ramesh: I'm good yaar. Just missing hanging out with you. Toh, what's your favorite family tradition?
Sejal: Oh, definitely when we celebrate Diwali. Ghar par sab itna khush hota hai! We decorate the house with diyas and rangolis. It's so much fun.
Ramesh: Oh wow! Mujhe bhi rangoli banana aata hai. Can I join you and learn some new designs?
Sejal: Of course, Ramesh! That would be amazing. We can have a rangoli competition. Winner gets a special homemade sweet dish.
Ramesh: Mmm, I can't wait to taste that sweet dish. Tumhare ghar mein kaun banata hai wo?
Sejal: My mom makes the best ladoos. Unki recipe sadiyon purani hai. I'll make sure you get to taste them.
Ramesh: That's so sweet of you, Sejal. Tumhari mom se baat karne ka chance milega.
Sejal: Haha, don't think you can charm her like that. Woh khud bahut shatir hain. But I'm sure she'll like you.
Ramesh: Challenge accepted, Sejal! I will win her heart with my charm and of course, my love for her ladoos.
Sejal: Ramesh, you and your charm! Anyway, what about your favorite family tradition?
Ramesh: Well, we have this annual family trip to our ancestral village. Sab cousins and chachas- chachis gather for a week. We have so much masti together.
Sejal: Aww, that sounds like so much fun, yaar. I've always wanted to experience that kind of togetherness with my extended family.
Ramesh: You should definitely join us next time. I could be your personal tour guide and show you all our crazy traditions!
Sejal: That sounds tempting, Ramesh. Tour guide and all huh? But first, you have to survive the rangoli competition. I won't go easy on you.
Ramesh: Challenge accepted, Sejal! I'll bring my A-game. I can't wait to spend more time with you and your family. We're going to have a blast!
Sejal: Yes, Ramesh. It will be an amazing time. I'm really looking forward to it. But for now, let's focus on enjoying each other's company.
Ramesh: Absolutely, Sejal. We'll make countless memories together. And who knows, maybe someday our families will celebrate our traditions together too.
Sejal: Ramesh, you always know how to make my heart flutter. Let's keep creating beautiful memories together, starting with our rangoli competition.
