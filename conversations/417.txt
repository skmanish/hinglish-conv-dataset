Rohan: Oye Pooja, tu kaisi hai? Kya chal raha hai?
Pooja: Mera din thik hai, Rohan! Just trying to decide on a new mobile phone. Tum batao, which one should I go for?
Rohan: Phone ke bare mein toh main expert hoon. Tell me your budget, I'll help you decide the best one.
Pooja: Budget is around 15,000 rupees. Any suggestions?
Rohan: Well, I would recommend the Redmi Note 9 Pro. It has a great camera, powerful processor, and long-lasting battery life. Plus, it fits within your budget.
Pooja: Really? But I've heard good things about the Realme Narzo 30 Pro too. It looks quite impressive with its 5G capability.
Rohan: Yeah, Realme Narzo 30 Pro is a good choice too. But Redmi Note 9 Pro has a better overall performance. Trust me on this.
Pooja: Hmm, you do have a point there. I'll consider it. By the way, which earphones are you using these days?
Rohan: I recently got the Boat Rockerz 255 Pro. They have great sound quality and the battery lasts for a long time. Plus, they are wireless, which is quite convenient.
Pooja: Wireless earphones sound amazing! I might go for them too. Thanks for the suggestion, Rohan.
Rohan: No problem at all, Pooja. I'm always here to help you out. So, are you free this weekend? We can go phone shopping together.
Pooja: That sounds like a plan, Rohan. Shopping with you will be fun.
Rohan: Great! We'll explore all the options and find the perfect phone for you. Plus, I have a surprise for you at the end of our shopping trip.
Pooja: Oh, really? Now you have piqued my curiosity. Can't wait for the surprise!
Rohan: It's a secret for now, but I can assure you it'll be worth the wait. Anyway, let's meet at the mall at 11 am on Saturday.
Pooja: Done deal, Rohan. See you on Saturday then. I'm excited for both the phone and the surprise now!
Rohan: Same here, Pooja. Get ready for an amazing time. I know the perfect phone and the perfect moment to make this day memorable for both of us.
Pooja: Wow, you really know how to keep the suspense alive, don't you? I'll be eagerly waiting!
