Rohan: Hey Riya, I heard there's some gossip floating around. Care to fill me in?
Riya: Oh, you're always curious about the latest scoop, aren't you? Well, let me tell you, it's juicy!
Rohan: Spill it, Riya! I'm all ears.
Riya: Well, it seems like Rahul and Pooja are secretly dating. Can you believe it?
Rohan: Are you serious? I had no idea! They've been keeping it under wraps, I guess.
Riya: Yes, they are trying to keep it on the down-low, but you know how gossip spreads like wildfire in our group.
Rohan: No wonder they've been acting so weird lately. I wonder how long they'll hide it.
Riya: I have a feeling it won't be for long. Someone is bound to spill the beans sooner or later.
Rohan: I bet everyone's going to be shocked when they find out. It's going to be a major scandal.
Riya: Oh, you love a good scandal, don't you? But let's not forget, we have our own secrets too.
Rohan: Haha, true. Our little secret is safe with us, right?
Riya: Absolutely! We're experts at keeping things under wraps, unlike Rahul and Pooja.
Rohan: Talking about secrets, I have something important to confess to you, Riya.
Riya: Oh, really? Now you've got me all curious. What's your secret, Rohan?
Rohan: Well, the truth is, I can't stop thinking about you, Riya. You've captured my heart.
Riya: Rohan, I... I didn't expect you to say that. You've also occupied a special place in my heart.
Rohan: Riya, I've been waiting for the right moment to tell you. I adore everything about you.
Riya: You're amazing, Rohan. I've fallen for your charms too. This gossip made us realize our true feelings!
Rohan: It's incredible how a simple conversation about gossip led us to this romantic moment. I'm so glad our paths crossed.
Riya: Me too, Rohan. Who would have thought our little chat would result in something so beautiful?
Rohan: Let's keep this flame burning, Riya. Our love story deserves a grand beginning.
Riya: Absolutely, Rohan. I can't wait to see where this journey takes us. We'll make our own headlines now!
