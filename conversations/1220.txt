Rohan: Hi, Kavya! Tum kaisi ho? Long time no see!
Kavya: Hey, Rohan! Main bilkul theek hun, bas thoda busy thi. Tum bhi kaise ho?
Rohan: I'm good too. Just missing our late-night calls and endless conversations. Remember those?
Kavya: Haan, I do. They were such golden days. Ab sab badal gaya hai.
Rohan: Haan, yaar. Ab toh log itne busy ho gaye hai, relationships ko time hi kahan milta hai?
Kavya: Sach hai, relationships banana ab kaafi challenging ho gaya hai. Online dating apps toh kuch help karte hai, but sometimes it feels superficial.
Rohan: True, sometimes it becomes more about swiping left or right than actually getting to know someone. Aur phir compatibility ke bina toh kuch bhi nahi hota.
Kavya: Exactly! Compatibility toh ek major issue hai. Log bade fast-paced ho gaye hai, commitment ka dar rehta hai zyada se zyada.
Rohan: Haan, log sochte hai "kya pata kal yeh hi humara future partner na ho jaye?" Par pyar toh rishton ko nurture karne mein hi hota hai na?
Kavya: Sahi baat hai! People are quick to judge and even quicker to discard relationships. Patience and understanding are losing their place in today's generation.
Rohan: Absolutely. But it's not just about compatibility, kuch log samajhte hai ki relationships sirf timepass ke liye hoti hai.
Kavya: Oh my god! Pata hai, some guys assume every girl is just looking for a casual fling. Aur phir they just play with emotions.
Rohan: That's really unfair. Ek dusre ke feelings ka respect hona chahiye. Aur dosti toh foundation hoti hai strong relationships ki.
Kavya: Exactly! Dosti, trust, and open communication are crucial. Baat nahi hogi to misunderstandings ho jayengi.
Rohan: I couldn't agree more. Aur aisi misunderstandings build up karke, relationship ki doriyan toot jaati hai.
Kavya: True. Lekin har situation mein it's important to keep the faith and understand each other's point of view.
Rohan: Absolutely, trust and understanding aapas mein honi chahiye. Aur jab woh hoti hai, toh relationship ka magic ho jata hai.
Kavya: Hmm... Magic, huh? Waise, Rohan, tumhare liye kuch magic bacha hai ki nahi?
Rohan: Well, Kavya, agar tumhare paas thoda time ho, toh I'd be more than happy to show you some magic.
Kavya: Oh really? Toh phir mujhe bade curious hone ki zarurat nahi hai. Kab aapka magic show dekh sakti hun?
Rohan: Tum batao, kabhi bhi. Mere liye toh kabhi bhi magic moment banane ke liye ready hoke aao.
Kavya: Challenge accepted! Ab toh mujhe bhi magic tricks seekhne hoge.
Rohan: Don't worry, I'll be your personal magician. Ab aaram se humari dosti aur pyar hoke badhta jaa raha hai.
Kavya: I'm looking forward to it, Rohan. Kyunki tumhare saath har pal ek naya magic moment hai.
