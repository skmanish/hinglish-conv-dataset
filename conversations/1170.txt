Rahul: Hey Deepika, yaad hai kuch college festival ke din? Wo toh masti ki thi yaar!
Deepika: Haan Rahul, kaise bhool sakti hoon! Woh sare college fests humare best memories mein se hai.
Rahul: Yaar, remember jab hum dono ne ek saath dance performance kiya tha? Wo wala fest yaad hai?
Deepika: Haan yaar, College fest ka dance competition tha na. Kitna practice kiya tha humne uske liye!
Rahul: Aur woh moment jab humara performance end hua aur saare audience humare applause kar rahe the. It was magical!
Deepika: Haha, haan yaad hai. Tabhi toh humare beech mein phir se jhakham nahi the, sab thik ho gaya tha.
Rahul: Aur woh college fest ki street food stalls. Kya mast hote the wo!
Deepika: Haan, yaad hai wo cheese burst maggi, crispy parathe aur ice cream stalls! Bas thinking about it makes my mouth water.
Rahul: Aur woh time jab hum college fest ke liye decorations karte the. Remember jab hume entire college ke saath ek theme choose karna tha?
Deepika: Haan yaar, remember kar rahi hoon. We all decided to go with a Bollywood theme, and we decorated the entire campus with Bollywood posters!
Rahul: Haan, and I still remember seeing you dressed as Madhuri Dixit. Tumne toh puri Madhuri jaisi dikhai thi!
Deepika: Rahul, stop flirting! Haan, lekin woh din bahut special tha. Hum sab ne bahut hard work kiya tha.
Rahul: Tum toh hamesha hi special ho, Deepika. Aur woh fest ki last night, remember hum sab friends ek saath dance floor pe groove kar rahe the.
Deepika: Haan, woh night unforgettable hai. Aur especially woh moment jab humari nazrein sirf ek dusre par thi, sab kuch bhool gaye the.
Rahul: Haan, Deepika, I never told you this before, but I have always had feelings for you, even during those college fests.
Deepika: Rahul, even I have always felt a special connection between us. The college fests brought us closer, but I never thought you felt the same way.
Rahul: Well, Deepika, aaj ke din yeh sachai samne aayi hai. Aur mujhe lagta hai ab hume iss connection ko explore karna chahiye.
Deepika: Rahul, I have always wanted to explore it too. Yeh college fest ke memories humare beech ka pehla chapter hai.
Rahul: Deepika, aaj ke din se humare beech ek nayi kahani shuru hogi. I promise to always cherish these memories with you.
Deepika: Rahul, you are making me blush! I'm excited to see where this new chapter takes us. Let's create more beautiful memories together!
Rahul: Absolutely, Deepika. Abhi ke liye bas yehi khayal apne dil mein rakhte hain.
