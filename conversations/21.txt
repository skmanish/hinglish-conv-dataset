Rohan: Hey Riya, have you checked out the latest DIY craft video on YouTube? It's so cool!
Riya: Oh really, Rohan? I haven't yet. What's it about?
Rohan: It's about making beautiful handmade greeting cards using quilling techniques. I thought it would be something you'd like.
Riya: That sounds interesting! I've always wanted to try quilling. Can you share the link with me?
Rohan: Sure, here it is - "DIY Quilled Greeting Cards for Beginners". Let me know what you think after watching it.
Riya: Thanks, Rohan! I'll check it out right away and maybe we can make some together sometime.
Rohan: That would be amazing, Riya! We could have our own little craft corner. 
Riya: Definitely! We can make personalized cards for special occasions and surprise our loved ones.
Rohan: I really enjoy doing DIY projects. I've also started learning to play the guitar through YouTube tutorials.
Riya: Wow, I'm impressed, Rohan! I've always wanted to learn to play an instrument too. Which songs have you learned so far?
Rohan: I've learned a few Bollywood classics and some romantic numbers. Would you like me to play something for you?
Riya: Oh, I'd absolutely love that! How about a romantic song? Something that'll set the mood...
Rohan: Alright, here it goes. 
Riya:  Rohan, that was amazing! You play so well and your voice is so mesmerizing.
Rohan: Thank you, Riya. I'm glad you enjoyed it. Just wanted to impress someone as special as you.
Riya: You definitely succeeded, Rohan. You're a talented guy with a big heart.
