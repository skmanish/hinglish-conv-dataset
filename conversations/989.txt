Rahul: Hey, Pooja! Did you hear about our friend Ravi's wedding? 
Pooja: Haan, Rahul! I heard about it, it was just last week. Did you attend the wedding? 
Rahul: Nahin yaar, unfortunately, I couldn't make it. But I heard it was a grand affair. 
Pooja: Absolutely! I saw the pictures on Facebook, and the bride looked stunning. 
Rahul: Uff, don't even get me started on her. She was looking like a Bollywood heroine! 
Pooja: Haan yaar, she had that traditional bridal glow and her outfit was so beautiful. 
Rahul: Tum bhi toh kabhi dulhan banogi, aur woh bhi itni sundar? 
Pooja: Accha? Tum dulha kaise loge? 
Rahul: Who toh surprise hai, uss waqt bataunga. But you will definitely be the most beautiful dulhan. 
Pooja: Flirting shuru kar diya? 
Rahul: Haan woh toh ho gaya, par sach bol raha hoon. Tum toh shadi mein sabko spellbound karogi. 
Pooja: Achha, karna hai toh bilkul Biwi No. 1 ban jaaungi. 
Rahul: Podi, tu toh hamesha sabka dil jeet leti hai. Aur waise bhi, mujhe toh sirf teri fikr rehti hai.
