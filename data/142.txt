Akshay: Hey, Kavya! Kaisi ho? Did you try the new street food stall near our college?

Kavya: Hey Akshay! Main bilkul theek hu. No, I haven't tried it yet. Kaisa hai woh stall?

Akshay: Amazing yaar! Wahan par unki pani puri and pav bhaji toh next level hai. You have to try it!

Kavya: Oh wow! Main toh pani puri lover hu. Can't wait to try it now.

Akshay: Aur batao, what's your favorite street food in Delhi?

Kavya: Bhai, Delhi mein golgappe, chole bhature aur momos are unbeatable. I can't resist them!

Akshay: Haan yaar! Main bhi golgappe aur momos ka fan hu. Ek baar hum sach mein sabko try karna chahiye!

Kavya: Absolutely! We should plan a street food expedition soon. It'll be so much fun!

Akshay: Definitely! Imagine the two of us, hogging on delicious street food, exploring the hidden gems of Delhi.

Kavya: Sounds like a perfect plan, Akshay. And we can end it with some mouth-watering jalebis for dessert.

Akshay: Wah, wah! Tu toh dil jeet gayi, Kavya. Jalebis are my weakness too. Hum dono ek dusre ke saath jalebi khate hue aur mazey karenge.

Kavya: Haha, bilkul! Aise date pe main toh jaldi haan keh dungi. 

Akshay: Date!? Oh teri! Ab toh mujhe aur jyada excited ho gaya. I can't wait for our street food adventure and maybe something more?

Kavya: Akshay, tujhe bhi na! But I have to admit, it sounds quite romantic. Let's make it happen. 

Akshay: Done deal, Kavya. It will be the most spicy and sweet date ever. 

Kavya: Haha, perfect! Looking forward to it. 

Akshay: Same here, Kavya. By the way, you're looking stunning as always. 

Kavya: Thank you, Akshay! Tum bhi handsome lag rahe ho. 

Akshay: Shayari bhi maarni aati hai, aapko. You make me go crazy!

Kavya: Flirt karne mein tu kam nahi hai, Akshay. But I must say, I enjoy it. 

Akshay: Haha, that's the spirit, Kavya. Abhi se pyaar mein pagal ho raha hu main. 

Kavya: Achha hai, Akshay. Lekin humara pyaar aur street food ka date abhi baaki hai. Let's meet soon!

Akshay: Zaroor, Kavya. Milte hai jald hi. Until then, keep smiling and dreaming about our street food feast.

Kavya: Haha, I will, Akshay. Take care and see you soon. 

Akshay: You too, Kavya. Bye for now. 

Kavya: Bye!
