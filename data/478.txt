Amit: Hey Neha! Diwali is just around the corner. Any plans for the festival this year? 
Neha: Hi Amit! Yeah, I'm super excited for Diwali! I plan on spending time with my family, lighting diyas, and bursting some crackers. What about you? 
Amit: That sounds amazing, Neha! I'm also looking forward to celebrating with my family. We have this tradition of making rangoli designs together. It's such a fun activity!
Neha: Oh, I love making rangoli too! It's so creative and adds such a beautiful touch to the festival ambiance. We should have a rangoli competition sometime!
Amit: That's a great idea, Neha! I wouldn't mind competing with you. I'm sure our designs would be fabulous. By the way, have you thought about what you're wearing on Diwali night?
Neha: Hmm, not yet. Maybe a traditional saree with some sparkling jewelry. What about you, Amit? Have you decided on your outfit? 
Amit: Well, I was thinking of wearing a kurta pajama with a stylish jacket. I want to look dashing during the festival. You know, impress everyone with my style! *winks*
Neha: Oh, Amit, always trying to impress everyone! But I'm sure you'll look great. By the way, are you planning to attend any Diwali parties this year?
Amit: Well, actually, there's this party at my friend's place. Would you like to come with me? It'll be a lot of fun, Neha. We can dance, eat delicious food, and enjoy the festivities together.
Neha: Oh, I would love to come! It sounds like a blast. I can already imagine us dancing our hearts out and making the most of the celebration. Count me in, Amit! 
Amit: That's awesome, Neha! I'm glad you're joining me. I have this feeling it's going to be a memorable Diwali for both of us. You know, much more than just fireworks and sweets.
Neha: Hmm, what do you mean, Amit? Are you hinting at something special? 
Amit: Well, Neha, I can't deny that spending Diwali with you will be something special. Maybe, amidst the lights and festivities, we can create a beautiful moment of our own. What do you think?
Neha: Amit, you're so sweet! Diwali has always been one of my favorite festivals, and this year it might just become my most memorable one too. Let's make it a magical celebration together.
