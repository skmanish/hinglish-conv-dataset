Riya: Oh wow, same here! "Kota Factory" was so relatable, na? Classmates, exams, aur woh coping up with pressure. It's a must-watch. 
Akash: Bilkul, yaar! Humari life ki journey toh usme dikhti hai. Kuch tough choices, friendships, aur achievers ki story. Ekdam mast hai, woh series. 
Riya: Totally agree, Akash! Aur tu kabhi "Sacred Games" dekha hai? It's a thrilling series with amazing performances. 
Akash: Haan, Riya! "Sacred Games" mere all-time favorite hai. Thrilling suspense, powerful dialogues, aur Jatin Sarna ka character Sardarji.. mazedaar hai. 
Riya: Exactly! That show keeps you hooked till the end. And what about "Mirzapur"? Guns, politics, and intriguing characters, it has everything. 
Akash: Ohh, "Mirzapur" toh ultimate hai, Riya! Kaleen Bhaiya ka swag, Guddu Pandit ki energy, woh sab kuch ekdum blockbuster. 
Riya: Right, Akash! Waise ek aur web series hai, "Little Things". It's a cute slice-of-life series about a couple.

Riya: Absolutely! Btw, tumhe kya lagta hai, Akash, kis genre ki web series sabse zyada tarif-worthy hoti hai? 
Akash: Difficult question, Riya! But main toh psychological thrillers aur crime dramas ko extra tareef karta hun. Woh suspense aur storyline make them a top pick for me. 
Riya: Wow, I'm more into comedy-dramas, like "TVF Pitchers". It's a hilarious take on the startup culture. 
Akash: Haan, "TVF Pitchers" bhi super entertaining hai. Woh struggles, friendship, aur jokes.. sab perfect blend hai. 
Riya: Absolutely! Akash, mujhe ideas aa rahen hain for our next web series marathon. Kuch aur suggestions ho toh batao.

Akash: Well, Riya, surprises can be more exciting, right? Shayad woh humara next marathon bhi surprise-filled ho. 
Riya: Oh, lagna hi tha, Akash! Surprise bhi romantic hoga, kya?
