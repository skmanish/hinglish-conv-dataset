Raj: Hey Simran, mausam kitna badal gaya hai na! (Hey Simran, the weather has changed so much, right?)

Simran: Haan, Raj! Pichle hafte se sardi badh gayi hai. Subah subah uthte hi sweater pehenna pad raha hai. (Yes, Raj! The cold has increased since last week. We have to wear sweaters as soon as we wake up in the morning.)

Raj: Sahi keh rahi ho! Par mujhe accha lagta hai ye thand. Sab ke chehre laal ho jate hain aur coffee pine ka maza badh jata hai. (You're right! But I like this cold weather. Everyone's faces turn red, and the joy of drinking coffee increases.)

Simran: Raj, tu bhi na! Aisa kuch nahi hai. Sardi mein toh sirf chalna mushkil hota hai, aur shayad hi main kabhi coffee peeti hoon. (Raj, you're something else! It's not like that. It's difficult to walk in the cold, and I hardly ever drink coffee.)

Raj: Achha, toh kya pasand hai tujhe? Main abhi tujhe garam garam chai bana deta hu, sardi ka maza lete hue. (Oh, so what do you like then? Let me make you a hot cup of tea and enjoy the cold together.)

Simran: Raj, tujhe mera kuch nahi pata hai. Main chai ki jagah garam doodh peeti hoon sardiyo mein. Vo mujhe bahut achha lagta hai. (Raj, you don't know anything about me. I drink warm milk instead of tea in winters. I really like it.)

Raj: Garam doodh? Vah! Aisa kyun? Mujhe toh lagta hai ki aurat log chai zyada peeti hai. (Warm milk? Wow! Why is that? I thought women drink more tea.)

Simran: Raj, tumhare yeh gender stereotypes andar hi rakh lo! Chai ya doodh, koi farq nahi padta. Bas vo maza hai sardi ke mausam ka. (Raj, keep those gender stereotypes to yourself! It doesn't matter whether it's tea or milk. The joy is in the winter season.)

Raj: Theek hai, Simran. Agar tu chaahe, tabhi tujhe chai ya doodh banake pilaunga. Tumhari khushi mein hi meri khushi hai. (Alright, Simran. If you want, only then I'll make tea or milk and offer it to you. My happiness lies in your happiness.)

Simran: Raj, tune mujhe samjha diya hai. Tum bahut achhe ho. Waise, sardi ke mausam mein koi romance kiya hai? (Raj, you have understood me well. You're very sweet. By the way, have you ever had a romantic moment in winter?)

Raj: Rom-romantic moment? Abhi tak toh nahi, lekin tujhe dekhkar mujhe lag raha hai ki vo bhi jaldi hi ho jayega. (Ro-ro-romantic moment? Not yet, but looking at you, I feel like it will happen soon.)

Simran: Raj, tum bhi na! Tumhara dimaag hamesha romance mein hi chalta rehta hai. (Raj, you're something else! Your mind is always preoccupied with romance.)

Raj: Simran, ye budhape mein mujhe dekhkar tujhe koi shikayat nahi honi chahiye. Come on, ek romantic walk par chalte hain sardi ke mausam mein. (Simran, you shouldn't complain about me being romantic even when I'm older. Come on, let's go for a romantic walk in this winter season.)

Simran: Raj, tujhe shayad pata nahi hai ki mujhe teri harkaton se pyaar ho gaya hai. Chal, chalte hain walk par. (Raj, maybe you don't know that I've fallen in love with your mischief. Let's go for a walk.)

[They walk hand in hand, enjoying the winter breeze, and create beautiful memories that will last a lifetime.]
