Kunal: Hey Tina, kya haal hai? I heard about some interesting innovations in Indian healthcare. Kuch pata hai tujhe?

Tina: Hey Kunal, sab changa hai yaar! Haan, I've been reading about a new healthcare app called Practo that connects patients with doctors online. It's so convenient, no need to wait for hours at the clinic.

Kunal: Woah, that sounds amazing! Indian healthcare is definitely stepping up its game. Aur kuch innovations suna hai tune?

Tina: Good to hear you're interested! Ek aur innovation hai - AI-based diagnostic tools. These tools use artificial intelligence to analyze medical images and provide accurate diagnoses. It's like having an expert doctor with you all the time.

Kunal: That's mind-blowing! Itni advancements honi chahiye in our healthcare system. Aur tujhe pata hai, I recently read about a wearable device specially designed for asthma patients. It monitors their breathing patterns and alerts them when they need their inhaler. Kitna helpful hai na!

Tina: Wow, that's impressive! It's great to see technology being used to help people with specific health conditions. Ab patients ki care aur treatment both will become easier.

Kunal: Absolutely! And you know, these innovations are making healthcare more accessible in rural areas too. Telemedicine and mobile health vans are reaching remote villages to provide medical assistance. Isse healthcare divide bhi kam hoga.

Tina: That's wonderful to hear. It's important that everyone has access to quality healthcare. These innovations are really revolutionizing the way healthcare is delivered. Lagta hai humara desh healthcare mein bahut progress kar raha hai.

Kunal: True, Tina. Our country is making great strides in healthcare. And speaking of progress, tumhari smile to abhi tak mere dil ko chura rahi hai. Kya hum kahin bahar dinner pe jaa sakte hain?

Tina: Haha, Kunal! You always know how to bring a smile on my face. Dinner sounds like a perfect plan. Chalein, romantic moment banane?
