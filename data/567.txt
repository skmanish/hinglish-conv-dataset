Rohan: Hey Simran, have you ever been to Goa?
Simran: Haan, Rohan. I have been there many times. Goa is amazing! The beaches, the parties, the food - everything is just so perfect!
Rohan: True yaar! Goa is like a mini-foreign trip. But have you ever been to Manali?
Simran: Oh yes! Manali is also beautiful. The snow-capped mountains, the fresh air, and the adventure sports. It's like being in a winter wonderland.
Rohan: Hmm, true. But what about Rajasthan? The palaces, the rich culture, and the folk music. It has its charm, don't you think?
Simran: Absolutely! I agree, Rajasthan is incredible. The royal heritage and the vibrant festivals make it a unique destination. But what about Kerala?
Rohan: Yes, Kerala is like God's own country. The backwaters, the houseboats, and the lush greenery. It's so peaceful and serene.
Simran: You know what Rohan, we should plan a trip together one day. Explore all these places and create beautiful memories.
Rohan: That sounds like a fantastic idea, Simran. We can start with Goa, then Manali, Rajasthan, and end with Kerala.
Simran: Yes, and while exploring these places, we can also explore our feelings for each other.
Rohan: Simran, you always surprise me with your sweet words. I'd love to go on this journey with you, not just to these destinations but in life too.
Simran: Rohan, you make my heart skip a beat. I'm glad we can share this special bond, and I hope our journey of love is as beautiful as these destinations we dream of.
