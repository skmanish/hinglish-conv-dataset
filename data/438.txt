Rohan: Heya, Avani! Tumhara college selection process kaisa chal raha hai? 

Avani: Hey, Rohan! College selection toh kaafi confusing hai yaar. So many choices and options!

Rohan: Haan, mujhe bhi pata hai. But don't worry, I'm here to help you out. Tumne koi particular field ya stream ke baare mein socha hai?

Avani: Well, mujhe science aur technology kaafi pasand hai. So, I am considering engineering as a career option. What about you?

Rohan: That's great! Even I am interested in engineering. Architecture bhi mujhe kaafi allure karti hai. I can imagine us working together on a project someday.

Avani: Sounds interesting! Tumhe koi specific college ya university yaad hai jo tum prefer kar rahe ho?

Rohan: Honestly, maine kuch options research kiye hai. IIT Bombay and NIT Warangal are on my list. In Mumbai or Hyderabad, we could explore the city together while studying.

Avani: Wow, that sounds like a dream come true! But you know, I am also considering studying abroad. London ya New York, vaha padhayi karne ka experience alag hi hoga na?

Rohan: Definitely! Videsh mein padhayi ka charm aur exposure ekdum different hoga. Lekin, hum long-distance relationship manage kar paayenge? Distance matter nahi karta toh I would totally be on board!

Avani: Aww, don't worry, Rohan. We'll cross that bridge when we come to it. Abhi tak toh hum dost hai na? Aur dost toh saath mein hi college jaate hain.

Rohan: Absolutely! Hum bas dost nahi, best friends hain. Maine toh kabka decide kar liya hai ki tere saath apne sapne poore karne ke liye kahin bhi jaa sakta hun.

Avani: You always know how to make me smile, Rohan. Tumhara support aur confidence hamesha mera saath raha hai. Tumhe kisi situation mein bhi challenge nahi samjhungi.

Rohan: Avani, tumse pyaar karne laga hun. Tum mere doston ki sabse special ho. I can't imagine my life without you. Would you like to be more than just friends?

Avani: Rohan, tum mere dil mein bahut khaas jagah le chuke ho. I've fallen for you too, roz tere saath time spend karke lagta hai ki duniya kitni khubsurat hai.

Rohan: Avani, I can't express how happy I am right now. Tum mere saath ho, aur hum future mein saath success ki unchahiyo ko chhedege.

Avani: Rohan, you're my prince charming. I'm so lucky to have you by my side. Together, we will conquer the world and make our dreams come true.

Rohan: And I promise, Avani, ki main hamesha tumhe pyaar, respect aur support dunga. Together, we'll create a beautiful love story and stand by each other no matter what.

Avani: That's all I ever wanted, Rohan. True love and a partner for life. Sochenge hum dono saath mein, humari journey kahan start kare. But for now, I'm grateful for this incredible moment with you.

Rohan: Me too, Avani. Abhi ke liye, yeh pal bahut special hai. I can't wait to see what the future holds for us. I love you, Avani.

Avani: I love you too, Rohan. You're my sunshine and I'm excited for this beautiful journey ahead.
