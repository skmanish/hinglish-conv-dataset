Ayesha: Hey Varun, kaise ho? Long time no talk!
Varun: Ayesha, main bilkul theek hoon. Tum kaisi ho? Missed talking to you too!
Ayesha: I'm good too, Varun. So, have you discovered any new apps for studying and productivity?
Varun: Haan, Ayesha. Mere paas ek amazing app hai, 'Notion.' It's great for organizing notes and to-do lists.
Ayesha: Oh, interesting! Mujhe kabhi kabhi notes and tasks organize karne mein dikkat hoti hai. Could you teach me how to use it?
Varun: Of course, Ayesha! It's really user-friendly. Main tumhein seekha sakta hoon. How about we meet tomorrow and I'll show you?
Ayesha: That sounds great, Varun! Tomorrow afternoon at the cafe near our college?
Varun: Perfect! Milte hain wahan, Ayesha. It will be fun to catch up and explore the app together.
Ayesha: Definitely, Varun. I'm really excited. By the way, koi aur app bhi suggest karo for studying and time management.
Varun: Haan, main 'Forest' app use karta hoon. It helps in reducing distractions and staying focused while studying.
Ayesha: Wow, sounds useful! I'll definitely download it. Thank you for recommending, Varun.
Varun: You're welcome, Ayesha. Anything for you. Tumhari studies bhi toh meri priority hai.
Ayesha: That's really sweet of you, Varun. Tum bahut caring ho.
Varun: Aisa hi kuch hai tumhare liye, Ayesha. Tumhari happiness meri happiness hai.
Ayesha: Varun, tum bhi na... you always know how to make me feel special.
Varun: Kyunki tum mere liye special ho, Ayesha. *smiles*
Ayesha: *blushes* Varun, I really enjoy talking to you. You make everything so much better.
Varun: Ayesha, tumhare saath baat karke har pal khubsurat ho jata hai. I cherish our conversations too.
Ayesha: Varun, you're the best! Tumne mujhe bahut happiness di hai.
Varun: Aur tumne mujhe bahut pyaar diya hai, Ayesha. *holds Ayesha's hand* You mean the world to me.
Ayesha: *takes a deep breath* Varun, even I feel the same way about you. I love you too.
Varun: *smiles and pulls Ayesha closer* Ayesha, I'm the luckiest guy to have you in my life. I love you more.
