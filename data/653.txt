Riya: Hey Rohan! Kaise ho? You won't believe what I just discovered about Indian temples. 

Rohan: Hey Riya! Main theek hoon. Kya hua? Tell me everything you found. 

Riya: Well, you know how beautiful and intricate Indian temples are, right? But did you know each one has a unique design?

Rohan: Haan, I know they are magnificent, but mujhe lagta tha sabhi temples ek jaise hi hote hain. What makes them unique?

Riya: No, no! Har temple alag hai. For example, Konark Temple in Odisha captures the marvel of Sun God with its intricate stone carvings.

Rohan: Wow, that's fascinating! Aur koi unique design hai temples ki?

Riya: Haan, toh there's the Brihadeeswarar Temple in Thanjavur. It has a huge stone dome called the vimana that's considered one of the tallest in the world. It's a marvelous piece of engineering!

Rohan: Wah Riya, you have a great knowledge about temples. Tum architecture mein truly passionate ho.

Riya: Thank you, Rohan. Architecture and history are my true loves! Aur tumhare paas koi favorite temple hai?

Rohan: Well, I really admire the Kailash Temple in Ellora, Maharastra. It's carved out of a single rock, imagine the dedication and skill that went into it!

Riya: Oh wow, that sounds incredible! Yeh temples sach mein asli art pieces hain.

Rohan: Absolutely! In fact, I often wonder how they managed to sculpt such intricate details. It must have taken years of hard work.

Riya: That's true. And it's not just the outside, even the interior of temples have beautifully designed pillars and ceilings.

Rohan: Haan, I've heard about the majestic pillars in Meenakshi Amman Temple in Madurai. Each one is adorned with colorful sculptures.

Riya: Exactly, Rohan! The detailing in these temples is something to marvel at. Imagine being an architect working on such a masterpiece.

Rohan: I can only imagine the pride and satisfaction they would feel! Riya, tumhari passion dekhkar mujhe bhi architecture mein interest aa raha hai.

Riya: Really, Rohan? That's amazing! Ek din hum bhi apni architectural dreams poore karenge.

Rohan: Definitely, Riya! Together we can create something truly extraordinary, just like these temples.

Riya: Rohan, you always manage to surprise me with your enthusiasm. I'm so glad we share this mutual passion.

Rohan: Riya, it's not just architecture that makes me enthusiastic. Tumhare saath baat karne se hi mera dil khush ho jata hai.

Riya: Rohan... I... feel the same way too. Tum mere saath hamesha khushiyon ki ek nayi duniya banate ho.

Rohan: Riya, tum meri duniya ho. Can I confess something? I've always had a soft spot for you.

Riya: Rohan, even I have feelings for you. Tum mere dreams ki building ban gaye ho.

Rohan: Riya, main tumhe kabhi nahi chhodna chahta. Together, we'll build a love story more beautiful than any Indian temple.

Riya: Rohan, I'm so excited for this new chapter in our lives. Humari love story apne aap mein ek architectonic marvel ban jayegi!

Rohan: Haan, Riya. Our love will be as timeless as the designs of the Indian temples we admire.
