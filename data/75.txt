Aman: Hi Riya! Yahan par aake lag raha hai ki jaise hum backwaters ki magic mein khoye hain. (Hi Riya! It feels like we have lost ourselves in the magic of the backwaters here.)

Riya: Bilkul, Aman! Backwaters ki shaandaar beauty dekh kar toh dil garden garden ho gaya hai. (Absolutely, Aman! My heart is fluttering seeing the splendid beauty of the backwaters.)

Aman: Waise Riya, tumne socha hai ki agar hum yahaan ek din raat guzaarenge toh kaisa lagega? (By the way, Riya, have you ever thought how it would feel if we spend a day and night here?)

Riya: Aman, tum toh hamesha itne romantic ho! Lekin sochne mein koi harz nahi hai. (Aman, you're always so romantic! But there's no harm in thinking about it.)

Aman: Riya, imagine kar, hum ek chhoti si houseboat lenge aur apni pyari si kahani shuru karenge. (Riya, imagine, we rent a small houseboat and start our sweet little story.)

Riya: Wow, Aman! Woh toh amazing idea hai. Humein shayad kisi romantic Bollywood gaane ki jodi lagne lagegi. (Wow, Aman! That's an amazing idea. We might start looking like a romantic Bollywood song couple.)

Aman: Aur Riya, yahaan par jab raat hoti hai, toh backwaters ki har ek tarang humare liye romantic melody ban jaati hai. (And Riya, when night falls here, every ripple of the backwaters turns into a romantic melody for us.)

Riya: Sach hai, Aman! Yahaan ki environment hi itni pyaari hai ki bina kuch bole bhi hum dono ka dil ek doosre ki taraf khinchta hai. (You're right, Aman! The environment here is so lovely that even without saying anything, our hearts are drawn towards each other.)

Aman: Aisa lag raha hai ki hum dono ek saath yahaan unginat lamhe bita sakte hain. (It feels like we both can spend countless moments together here.)

Riya: Aman, backwaters ki khubsurti se kuch seekhna chahun toh woh hai dosti aur pyaar ka ehsaas. (Aman, if I want to learn something from the beauty of the backwaters, it is the feeling of friendship and love.)

Aman: Riya, yahaan hum dono ko backwaters ka magic hamesha yaad rahega. Aur yehi humari kahani ki shuruaat hogi. (Riya, the magic of the backwaters will always be remembered by us. And this will be the beginning of our story.)

Riya: Aman, yeh sab itna romantic ho raha hai ki mujhe tumhare kareeb aane ka mann kar raha hai. (Aman, all this is becoming so romantic that I feel like coming closer to you.)

Aman: Riya, tumhare kareeb aane ka mann toh mujhe bhi hai. Shayad yeh magical backwaters humein apne pyaar mein dooba denge. (Riya, I also have the desire to come closer to you. Maybe these magical backwaters will drown us in their love.)

Riya: Aman, kya hum ek dusre ke liye yahaan pyaar bharenge? (Aman, will we fill this place with love for each other?)

Aman: Riya, yeh pyaar humare dil mein hai bas, yahaan ki backwaters toh sirf use bahar nikalne ka zariya hai. (Riya, this love is in our hearts, the backwaters here are just a means to bring it out.)

Riya: Aman, aaj raat ek nayi shuruaat karte hain. Hamari kahani yahaan backwaters ki jaadu mein shuru ho jaaye. (Aman, let's start a new beginning tonight. Our story can begin in the magic of these backwaters.)

Aman: Riya, yahaan meri baahon mein aakar, hum shamshaan tak jaane wale pyaar aur dosti ki kasam khayenge. (Riya, coming into my arms here, we will swear on the love and friendship that will last till the end.)

Riya: Aman, tumhare saath yahaan hona hi ek khwaab sa lag raha hai. I can't believe that we are having such a magical romantic moment. (Aman, being here with you feels like a dream. I can't believe that we are having such a magical romantic moment.)

Aman: Riya, yeh khwaab sach ho jaayega, tum sirf haan keh do. (Riya, this dream will come true, just say yes.)

Riya: Aman, haan. Haan kehne se pehle hi tumne mera dil jeet liya tha. (Aman, yes. Even before saying yes, you had already won my heart.)

Aman: Riya, ab yeh backwaters, humari pyaar ki kahaani ka darpan ban gaye hain. (Riya, now these backwaters have become the mirror of our love story.)

[Riya smiles and they embrace, lost in the beauty of the backwaters and in each other's love.]
