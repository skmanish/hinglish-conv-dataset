Rohan: Hey Pooja, kaisa hai? Itni dino se kuch baat nahi hui!

Pooja: Hey Rohan! Haan, yaar, busy thi exams ke liye. Ab toh free ho gayi hoon, aur tum? 

Rohan: Oh, exams ke naam sunte hi dimaag mein dher saare movies ka thaana ban gaya! Koi acchi suggestion hai?

Pooja: Haan, kal tumhe ek movie dikhate hain, mujhe bahut pasand hai- "Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani".

Rohan: Seriously? Kabhi dekhi nahi, will definitely watch it with you. Dinner ke baad chale?

Pooja: Perfect! Ek hinglish movie followed by some delicious biryani sounds like a great plan.

Rohan: Sounds like a perfect Friday night! Aur Saturday ko kya plan hai?

Pooja: Ek idea hai...what if we have a sleepover at my place? We can binge-watch some more movies, order pizza, and have loads of fun!

Rohan: Wow, that sounds amazing! I'm totally in for a sleepover. But just one condition, only if we can watch some horror movies too!

Pooja: Haha, okay, but only if I can hold your hand whenever I get scared.

Rohan: Deal! Let's make it a movie marathon with a side of hand-holding then.

Pooja: Done! I'll get all the snacks ready. You better be prepared for a night filled with screams, laughter, and maybe a few cuddles.

Rohan: I wouldn't have it any other way. Can't wait for the weekend now. It's going to be the best sleepover ever!

Pooja: Same here, Rohan. It's going to be so much fun spending time with you. Can't wait to see you tomorrow!

Rohan: Me too, Pooja. Can't wait to spend some quality time with you. It's going to be an amazing weekend, I just know it.

Pooja: See you tomorrow, Rohan. Goodnight!

Rohan: Goodnight, Pooja. Sweet dreams!

[They both sign out of the chat with smiles on their faces, eagerly waiting for the weekend to begin.]
