Priya: Hey Rohan, I'm good! Yeah, actually I recently read about Malala Yousafzai, she's amazing!
Rohan: Oh, Malala is incredible! Her story is truly inspiring. Have you read her book?
Priya: Yes, I did. It's so inspiring how she fought for girls' education and stood up against the Taliban.
Rohan: Absolutely, she's a true role model for everyone. I also admire A.P.J Abdul Kalam, the missile man of India.
Priya: Oh yes, Kalam sir is such an inspiration! His dedication towards science and development is commendable.
Rohan: Definitely! He taught us to dream big and work hard to achieve our goals. Who else do you look up to?
