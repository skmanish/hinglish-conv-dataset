Rohan: Hey, Riya! You won't believe what I had for lunch today!
Riya: Hi, Rohan! What did you have? Don't make me jealous now!
Rohan: Haha! I went to this amazing street food stall near my office and had the most delicious chole bhature!
Riya: Oh wow, I love chole bhature! Where exactly is this stall?
Rohan: It's near Janpath market. You should definitely try it sometime!
Riya: Janpath is quite far from my place, but for good food, I won't mind the distance!
Rohan: That's the spirit, Riya! You're adventurous like me!
Riya: Well, when it comes to food, I'm always up for a little adventure!
Rohan: I knew we would have something in common! Food brings people together, doesn't it?
Riya: Absolutely! And exploring new street food stalls is a great way to bond too.
Rohan: So true! We should plan a food expedition someday, just you and me.
Riya: That sounds like a lot of fun! Count me in, Rohan.
Rohan: Great! We'll be food buddies then, Riya. I can't wait to try different foods with you.
Riya: Me neither, Rohan. It's going to be an amazing experience!
Rohan: Have you ever tried the famous golgappas from the street stalls nearby?
Riya: Of course, I have! They're my weakness. The tangy paani makes it irresistible.
Rohan: Oh, you like tangy flavors too? We're getting closer to being food soulmates!
Riya: Haha, you are definitely my kind of person, Rohan. I love trying different types of chaat as well.
Rohan: That's fantastic! We'll be unstoppable when it comes to street food then.
Riya: I have to agree with you there, Rohan. I'm already looking forward to our food expedition.
Rohan: Riya, you know what would make our food adventure even more perfect?
Riya: What's that, Rohan?
Rohan: If, after all the amazing food we eat, we end up stealing a romantic moment together.
Riya: Oh, Rohan! That's quite a bold suggestion. But, I have to admit, it sounds tempting.
Rohan: I can't help it, Riya. Spending time with you and sharing delicious food makes me feel a certain way.
Riya: I feel the same way, Rohan. The thought of it makes my heart skip a beat.
Rohan: Riya, would you like to go on a dinner date with me? Our very own little street food adventure?
Riya: Rohan, I would love that! I can't wait to explore the food world with you and maybe even steal that romantic moment too.
