Rohan: Hey Simran, tere ko yaad hai jab hum pehli baar gym gaye the?
Simran: Haan yaar, bilkul yaad hai! Woh workout session kitna mast tha na?
Rohan: Haan, woh trainers bhi bahut zabardast the, ek dum professionals.
Simran: Aur remember, we were so clueless about the exercises but they helped us out.
Rohan: Haha, yeah! Woh squats toh mujhe aaj bhi yaad hai, mere legs itne dard kar rahe the next day.
Simran: Oh god, I couldn't even walk properly for a week after that. Mazaa aa gaya!
Rohan: Kitna dedication hai tujhme! Tere fitness goals pe salute hai, yaar.
Simran: Thank you, Rohan! Tum bhi toh itne fit ho, mujhe motivate karte ho always.
Rohan: Bas tujhse dekhkar hi energy aa jati hai, Simran! Teri har step pe mujhe inspiration milti hai.
Simran: Awww, that's really sweet of you, Rohan. Tumhare saath gym me time spend karna, it's always fun.
Rohan: Haan yaar, tu bhi hai na. Warna boring ho jata gym ka routine.
Simran: True. By the way, tune abhi tak koi naye workouts try kiye hai ya koi interesting fitness tips?
Rohan: Haan, maine thoda weight training shuru kiya hai. It's been really challenging but I'm loving it.
Simran: Wow, that's amazing! Ab tak mujhe weight training se dar lagta tha, lekin tujhe dekhkar confidence aa raha hai try karne ka.
Rohan: Don't worry, I'll be there to guide you. Together we can conquer any fitness challenges, Simran.
Simran: Thanks, Rohan! Tere saath training karna, it sounds like a perfect plan to me.
Rohan: Haan toh, kal gym chalein? We can try some new exercises together.
Simran: Definitely! Mai kal se tere saath apni fitness journey aur exciting banaungi.
Rohan: Can't wait to see you there, Simran. We'll make every workout session memorable.
Simran: Absolutely, Rohan! Saath me gym jane ke baad, ek healthy dinner bhi toh banta hai.
Rohan: Haha, bilkul! Tujhe kya pasand hai healthy dinner me? Kuch specific cravings hai?
Simran: Hmm, I love salads and grilled chicken. Woh bhi kha lenge fir, after the gym session?
Rohan: Perfect choice! Gym ke baad wo sab kha kar energy recharge kar lenge.
Simran: Sounds like a plan, Rohan. Ab agar tere paas koi tips hai flirt karte hue toh batao, I'm all ears.
Rohan: Well, Simran, I think you already know this, tu bahut beautiful lagti hai jab tujhe koi compliment karta hai. Hai na?
Simran: Awww, thank you, Rohan! Tera compliment sunke mujhe bhi accha lagta hai.
Rohan: Ab toh bas ek hi cheez hai jo missing hai - humara date! Gym ke baad woh bhi plan kar lenge?
Simran: Absolutely, Rohan! Ek romantic dinner date plan karte hai. I'm looking forward to it.
Rohan: Me too, Simran. Abhi se mere dil ki heartbeat gym se zyada fast ho gayi hai tere saath date pe jane ki feeling se.
Simran: Haha, mujhe bhi wahi feeling hai, Rohan! Gym se date tak, humari journey bhi kuch alag ho rahi hai.
Rohan: Bilkul, Simran. Ab toh workout bhi aur mazedaar ho jayega, knowing we have something special to look forward to.
Simran: Absolutely, Rohan. Abhi se woh gym session aur special hone wala hai.
Rohan: Can't wait for our fitness journey to continue, and for us to build something beautiful together, Simran.
Simran: Me too, Rohan. Ab ek hi cheez missing hai, tumhara gym se wapas aane ka time. I'm counting down the moments.
Rohan: It won't be long, Simran. Let's make every moment count, both inside and outside the gym.
Simran: I'm all in, Rohan. Ab chalte hai, fitness ke liye tayyar rehna aur pyaar bhare moments ke liye bhi!
Rohan: Absolutely, Simran. Fit rehkar hi woh special moments aur special connection banayenge. Dil se, body se.
Simran: Couldn't agree more, Rohan. We're gonna make it a fit and fab journey together, both for ourselves and for us.
