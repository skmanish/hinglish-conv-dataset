Rahul: Hey Pooja, ek baat puchu? (Hey Pooja, can I ask you something?)
Pooja: Haan bolo, kya baat hai Rahul? (Yes, tell me Rahul, what's the matter?)
Rahul: Tumhe lagta hai traditional aur modern designs ko India me blend karke ek naya trend create kar sakte hai? (Do you think we can create a new trend by blending traditional and modern designs in India?)
Pooja: Rahul, mujhe lagta hai aaj kal yeh blend hi humare desi outfits ko unique aur stylish banata hai. (Rahul, I think nowadays this blend makes our traditional outfits unique and stylish.)
Rahul: Sach keh rahi ho Pooja! Maanne padega, aap hai fashion expert! (You're right, Pooja! Gotta accept that, you're the fashion expert!)
Pooja: Haha, shukriya Rahul! Lekin tum bhi bahut creative ho, mujhe tumhare designs pasand hai. (Haha, thank you Rahul! But you are really creative too, I like your designs.)
Rahul: Aw, dil khush ho gaya sunke. Tumhare liye kuch special design karu? (Aw, my heart is happy hearing that. Should I create something special for you?)
Pooja: Rahul, tumne toh mujhe surprise de diya! Jarur, I would love that. (Rahul, you already surprised me! Definitely, I would love that.)
Rahul: Hmmm, soch raha hoon, ek beautiful saree design karna chahiye, traditional touch ke saath. (Hmmm, I'm thinking of creating a beautiful saree design with a traditional touch.)
Pooja: Saree toh meri favorite hai, aur agar tum design karte ho toh woh toh mujhe bahut pasand aayegi. (Saree is my favorite, and if you design it, I will surely love it.)
Rahul: That's great! Waise, tum Indian wedding dress ke liye traditional ya modern design prefer karti ho? (By the way, do you prefer traditional or modern designs for Indian wedding dresses?)
Pooja: Dono hi mujhe suit karte hai, lekin ek mix karke unique look banane ka try karti hoon. (Both suit me, but I try to create a unique look by mixing them.)
Rahul: Tumhari tasveer humare designs ki inspiration ban sakti hai. Tum ek perfect blend ho traditional aur modern ki. (Your picture can be an inspiration for our designs. You are a perfect blend of traditional and modern.)
Pooja: Rahul, tum bada tez praise kar rahe ho, par mujhe achcha lag raha hai. (Rahul, you're praising too much, but I'm liking it.)
Rahul: Sach kah raha hoon, Pooja. Tumhari saath wali photo dekh kar mujhe ek naya design idea aa gaya hai. (I'm telling the truth, Pooja. I got a new design idea after seeing a photo of you.)
Pooja: Really? Toh mujhe bhi woh design dekhaana! (Really? Then show me that design too!)
Rahul: Haha, abhi nahi, agli baar personal tashreef lete hain design dikhane ke liye. (Haha, not now, next time I'll personally come to show you the design.)
Pooja: Hmm, toh mujhse date pe chaloge? Waise bhi tumhara design dekhe bina mujhe chain nahi aayega. (Hmm, so will you take me on a date? Anyway, I won't be able to relax without seeing your design.)
Rahul: Pooja, tumhara yeh request manzoor hai. Date pe chalenge aur wapas design ke baare me baat karenge. (Pooja, your request is granted. We'll go on a date and then talk about the design.)
Pooja: Yay! Rahul, tum sach mein kamal ho. Can't wait for our date! (Yay! Rahul, you're amazing. Can't wait for our date!)
Rahul: Mujhe bhi. Bas tumhari muskurahat dekhne ki intezaar hai. (Me too. Just waiting to see your smile.)
Pooja: Rahul, tum sach mein naughty ho gaye ho. Achha, chalo abhi tak toh bahut baat ho gayi hai, let's meet soon! (Rahul, you've become really naughty. Alright, we've talked a lot, let's meet soon!)
Rahul: Haan, jarur Pooja. Kabhi bhi, kahin bhi, tumhare liye samay nikal lunga. (Yes, for sure, Pooja. Anytime, anywhere, I will make time for you.)
Pooja: Aww, tum bhi na! Accha abhi jao, aur design create karte raho. Bye Rahul! (Aww, you too! Okay, now go and keep creating designs. Bye Rahul!)
Rahul: Bye Pooja! Aur haan, ab tak toh sirf designs dekhe hai, lekin jab personal milege tab aur bhi kuch accha hoga. (Bye Pooja! And yes, till now we have only seen designs, but when we meet personally, there will be even more good things!)
Pooja: Dekhenge Rahul, abhi ke liye, take care! (We'll see, Rahul. For now, take care!)
