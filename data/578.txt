Raj: Hey, Riya! Dekh, I just bought the latest iPhone 12 Pro. It's amazing yaar!
Riya: Waah Raj, that's great! Mujhe bhi lena chahiye tha, par yaar itna expensive hai na.
Raj: Don't worry, Riya. It's worth every penny! The camera quality is mind-blowing. Tujhe dikhaun? 
Riya: Haan, zaroor! Show me the pictures you've clicked with it.
Raj: Sure, Riya. Yeh dekh, I clicked this beautiful sunset picture near Marine Drive. Doesn't it look stunning? 
Riya: Wow, Raj! Yeh toh breathtaking hai! The camera captures every detail perfectly.
Raj: Haan, bhai! Aur portrait mode se selfies click karne ka toh alag hi mazaa hai. The background blur is so cool.
Riya: True, Raj! It gives a professional touch to the photos. Lekin zyaada selfie lene se toh phone ka storage full ho jaata hoga na?
Raj: Not with this phone, Riya. It has a huge storage capacity of 256GB. Ab unlimited memories capture kar sakte hai hum.
Riya: That's awesome, Raj! Itne saare photos and videos save kar sakte hai ab without any worries.
Raj: Haan, aur iske alawa wireless charging bhi hai. Ek maheene pehle se use kar raha hoon and trust me, it's super convenient.
Riya: Really? That sounds amazing! Itna time bachega charging mein. I must get my hands on this gadget soon.
Raj: Riya, why wait? Aaj hi order kar le. We can explore all its features together and bina time waste kiye hamesha connected reh sakte hai.

Riya: Raj, you're too sweet! Tere saath time spend karna mere liye bhi precious hai.
Raj: Riya, tum mere liye khaas ho. I'm really glad to have you in my life.
Riya: Raj, tu bhi mere liye bahut important hai. Life mein tere bina khush rehna possible hi nahi hai.
