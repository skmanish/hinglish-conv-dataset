Rohan: Hey Shruti, have you read any good books lately?
Shruti: Hi Rohan! Yes, I recently finished reading "The God of Small Things" by Arundhati Roy.
Rohan: Oh, that's a classic! The way Roy beautifully captures the emotions and complexities of the characters is just amazing.
Shruti: Absolutely! The way she weaves together social issues, family dynamics, and love in her storytelling is extraordinary. It's a must-read for everyone.
Rohan: I completely agree! Have you read anything by Chetan Bhagat?
Shruti: Yes, I have. I enjoyed "Five Point Someone", but I feel his writing style is more suited for young adult readers.
Rohan: Yeah, his books are definitely easier reads compared to the deep literary works. But he does bring out relatable themes and contemporary issues well.
Shruti: True, his stories often focus on the struggles and dreams of the young generation. It's nice to see Indian writers addressing such topics.
Rohan: Absolutely! Our literature is evolving, and we have talented authors exploring various genres like historical fiction, fantasy, and crime too.
Shruti: That's so exciting! It shows the diversity and richness of our culture being reflected in the literary world.
Rohan: Indeed! It's amazing how Indian authors are now gaining popularity globally as well. Speaking of which, have you read "The White Tiger" by Aravind Adiga?
Shruti: Yes, that book was mind-blowing! Adiga's dark humor and social commentary kept me hooked till the end. It deserved the Man Booker Prize it received.
Rohan: I completely agree, Shruti. His portrayal of social inequality and the protagonist's struggle to break free from the system was thought-provoking.
Shruti: Absolutely, Rohan. It made me reflect on our society and the disparities that exist. It's great to see such powerful literature being written.
Rohan: It definitely is, Shruti. Talking about literature with you is so engaging. I love how we can discuss our favorite books and authors.
Shruti: I feel the same, Rohan. It's refreshing to have meaningful conversations about literature and exchange perspectives.
Rohan: You have a way of making even the simplest conversations enjoyable, Shruti. I look forward to talking to you about books and many other things.
Shruti: That's so sweet of you to say, Rohan. I also enjoy talking to you. And who knows what other interesting conversations lie ahead for us.
Rohan: Well, I hope those conversations include more moments like this where we can connect and share our passions. 
Shruti: Me too, Rohan. It's a wonderful feeling to have someone who appreciates literature as much as I do.
