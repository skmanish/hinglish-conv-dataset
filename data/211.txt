Rohit: Hello Riya, kaisi ho? Long time no see!
Riya: Hey Rohit, mai theek hu, thank you. Tum batao, where were you hiding all this time?
Rohit: Riya, I was busy with my internship. It was such a rollercoaster ride, yaar!
Riya: Oh really? How was it? Batao mujhe!
Rohit: Well, it was challenging yet exciting. Deadline pressure, multitasking, and all that jazz, you know?
Riya: Haan, I can totally relate. Even I had a crazy part-time job at a café. Kafi mushkil tha, but I learned a lot.
Rohit: That's great! Tell me more about it. Tumhe kya kya sikha?
Riya: Well, handling difficult customers and managing time efficiently were the major challenges. But it made me more confident and improved my communication skills.
Rohit: That's something! I can imagine how it must have felt dealing with those cranky customers. You must be a pro now!
Riya: Haha, not exactly a pro, but definitely better than before. Tumhare internship me koi interesting incident hua?
Rohit: Haan, ek baar boss ne mujhse kaha ki computer ko repair karke uski files recover karke aao. I was panicking because I had never done that before. But I managed to fix it!
Riya: Wow, Rohit, that's amazing! I'm proud of you. You must have felt so accomplished, right?
Rohit: Haan, bilkul. The feeling of successfully completing a task that seemed impossible initially is unparalleled!
Riya: Every accomplishment counts, indeed! By the way, I forgot to ask, which café did you work at?
Rohit: Oh, it was a small café named "Cup of Joy" near my college. The place had a cozy ambiance and the aroma of coffee was mind-blowing!
Riya: Oh, I know that place! I am a coffee lover too. Next time, let's go there together and create some beautiful memories!
Rohit: That's a great idea! I would love to be your partner in crime and discover more amazing coffee places with you, Riya.
Riya: Mera bhi yahi sapna hai. I'm glad we're on the same page, Rohit. Let's make it happen!
Rohit: Absolutely, Riya! Doston ko inform karte hai aur jald se jald ek plan finalize karte hai. I can't wait to spend more time with you!
Riya: Same here, Rohit! It's going to be so much fun. Let's make this internship and part-time job talk just the beginning of our journey together!
Rohit: Absolutely, Riya. Ab toh ek romantic moment ban gaya hai, right? Hamesha sath rahenge hamesha!
Riya: Sahi kaha! Hamesha sath rahenge, aur hamesha pyaar barte rahenge.
