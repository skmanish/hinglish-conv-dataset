Rohan: Hey Priya, tum traditional wear pehente ho ya western wear?

Priya: Hey Rohan, mujhe dono pasand hai lekin traditional wear mujhe zyada suit karte hain. Tum kya kehte ho?

Rohan: Mujhe bhi traditional wear bahut acchi lagti hai, especially when it comes to sarees. Tum saree mein bahut beautiful lagti ho.

Priya: Awww, thank you Rohan. Tumhara koi favorite traditional outfit hai?

Rohan: Haan, mere liye nothing beats the charm of a well-fitted kurta pajama. It gives a certain elegance and regal feel, don't you think?

Priya: Absolutely! Kurta pajama pehenne se logon ki personality aur confidence badh jaati hai. It's a timeless classic.

Rohan: Sahi keh rahi ho. Waise, tum western wear mein bhi bahut stylish aur confident lagti ho.

Priya: Oh really? Toh tumhe western wear mujh par suit karti hai?

Rohan: Haan, bilkul. Tum jab bhi western outfits mein rahti ho, tumhara style aur attitude ekdum rocking hota hai.

Priya: Thanks, Rohan. Tum bhi toh hamesha smart dikhate ho, chahe traditional wear ho ya western wear.

Rohan: Waise, kya tumne kabhi western wear mein saree try ki hai?

Priya: Nahi, kabhi nahi ki. Waise bhi, saree ko western wear ke saath impossible combination lagta hai. Tum kya kehte ho?

Rohan: Well, I think saree ko western twist ke saath carry karne se bohot unique aur attractive look ho sakta hai. Tumhara try karne ka mood hai?

Priya: Hmm, interesting. Shayad ekbaar try karungi. Par mujhe thoda guidance chahiye.

Rohan: Don't worry, main hoon na! Main tumhe help karunga. Ek din mere saath shopping chalegi?

Priya: Pakka, shopping date par chalenge? Sounds like fun!

Rohan: Absolutely, it'll be a great time together. Aur jab tum western wear mein saree rock karogi, I'll be the proudest guy in the room.

Priya: Aww, you always know how to make me feel special. You're too sweet, Rohan.

Rohan: Bas tumhare liye. Tum bahut special ho mere liye, Priya.

Priya: Achha? Toh iss special moment ko celebrate karte hain, dinner par chale?

Rohan: Perfect idea, Priya. Can't wait for our dinner date.
