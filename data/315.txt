Rohan: Hey, Sneha! Kaisi ho? Any interesting culinary adventures to share?
Sneha: Hey, Rohan! Main bilkul theek hoon. Well, I recently tried making a spicy chatpata pav bhaji at home. It was so delicious!
Rohan: Wow, that sounds amazing! I love pav bhaji too. Which masala did you use? 
Sneha: I used a homemade masala mix, Rohan. It had a perfect blend of spices like coriander, cumin, and garam masala. The aroma was irresistible!
Rohan: That's so cool, Sneha! I wish I could taste it too. You should open your own restaurant someday. 
Sneha: Haha, thank you, Rohan! Who knows, maybe someday I might open a little Bhaji Bistro of my own. 
Rohan: Sneha's Bhaji Bistro, sounds amazing! I would be your number one customer, for sure. 
Sneha: Aww, you're too sweet, Rohan! What about you? Any culinary stories you'd like to share?
Rohan: Well, recently I tried making crispy and spicy chicken 65. It turned out to be finger-licking good! 
Sneha: Oh, I love chicken 65! That's one of my favorite dishes. What's your secret, Rohan? Share the recipe!
Rohan: Sneha, my secret is marinating the chicken in a blend of yogurt, red chili powder, and some secret herbs before frying it. It gives it that perfect tangy and spicy flavor.
Sneha: That's a brilliant idea, Rohan! I'll definitely try that next time I make it. I can't wait to taste your version of chicken 65.
Rohan: Sneha, I would love to cook it for you one day. Maybe we can have a cooking date at my place?
Sneha: Wow, a cooking date with you sounds like so much fun, Rohan! I'd love that.
Rohan: Sneha, you know what they say, food is the way to the heart. And I want to win yours over with my cooking.
Sneha: Haha, cheesy but true, Rohan! I'm already falling for your culinary skills. Let's see if your food can win me over completely. 
Rohan: Challenge accepted, Sneha! I can't wait to sweep you off your feet, one delicious bite at a time. 
Sneha: I'm looking forward to it, Rohan. I'm sure it'll be a memorable and mouthwatering experience.
