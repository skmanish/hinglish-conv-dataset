Akshay: Hey Riya! Long time no see! How's everything going?

Riya: Hey Akshay! I'm good, just caught up with work. How about you?

Akshay: Same here, work has been keeping me busy too. But hey, do you remember that one time in school when I fell while giving a presentation?

Riya: Oh god, how could I forget! You turned all shades of red, it was hilarious. But remember when I accidentally called the teacher 'mom' in front of the whole class?

Akshay: Haha! That was priceless! You were so embarrassed! But do you also remember when I tripped while going up the stairs and my books flew everywhere?

Riya: Oh yes, and everybody started laughing! But let me tell you another embarrassing thing that happened to me. Once, during a dance performance, I forgot all the steps and froze on stage!

Akshay: Oh no, that must have been so awkward! But I think it's cute when you get all shy like that. By the way, your smile has always made my heart skip a beat.

Riya: Aw, thanks Akshay! You're too sweet. But you know what, your sense of humor has always made me blush. I still remember those silly jokes you used to crack in class.

Akshay: Haha, I'm glad I could bring a smile to your face. You know, we've shared so many embarrassing moments together, it's like we were meant to meet and make each other laugh.

Riya: That's so true! I always feel comfortable around you, like I can be myself. It's rare to find someone who understands and accepts you completely.

Akshay: Absolutely, Riya. And I feel lucky to have found you. You're not just beautiful, but your caring nature and genuine soul make you even more special.

Riya: Oh Akshay, you know just the right words to melt my heart. I'm glad we have this connection, and it feels like there's something more between us.

Akshay: Riya, I've been trying to find the courage to say this... I think I'm falling in love with you. Will you be my girlfriend?

Riya: Akshay, you don't need to ask! My heart has already belonged to you for a while now. I'd be thrilled to be your girlfriend.

Akshay: Riya, you've made me the happiest guy in the world. I can't wait to create more beautiful memories with you by my side.

Riya: And I'm excited to embark on this journey of love and laughter with you, Akshay. You truly make my world brighter.
