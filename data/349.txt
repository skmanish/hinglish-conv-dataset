Amit: Hey, Riya! Aakhirii trekk kaafi maza aaya tha, na? (Hey, Riya! The last trek was so much fun, right?)

Riya: Haan yaar, bilkul! Itna khubsurat scenery, dil khush kar diya. (Yes, absolutely! The beautiful scenery made my heart happy.)

Amit: Woh moment jab hum pahaadon ke beech mein they, kitna jadoo sa tha na? (That moment when we were amidst the mountains, it was so magical, right?)

Riya: Haan, waise I loved how you guided us through the tough trails. Tum bahut strong ho, Amit. (Yes, by the way, I loved how you guided us through the tough trails. You are very strong, Amit.)

Amit: Thank you, Riya! Lekin tum toh meri spirit booster thi. If it wasn't for you, trek itna mazedaar nahi hota. (Thank you, Riya! But you were my spirit booster. If it wasn't for you, the trek wouldn't have been so enjoyable.)

Riya: Stop it, Amit. Tum bade cheesy ho. (Stop it, Amit. You're being too cheesy.)

Amit: Achha, waise woh falls remember karte ho? Kitna refreshing tha woh moment. (By the way, do you remember that waterfall? It was so refreshing.)

Riya: Haan yaar, woh paani ki thandak, humne toh puri tarahse bheeg gaye the. (Yes, that cool water, we got completely drenched.)

Amit: Tum toh wahan pe bahut cute lag rahi thi, dripping wet hair ke saath. (You were looking very cute there, with wet hair.)

Riya: Oh, stop it, Amit! Tum flirting kar rahe ho. (Oh, stop it, Amit! You're flirting.)

Amit: Main flirt nahi kar raha, sach bol raha hoon. (I'm not flirting, I'm telling the truth.)

Riya: Achha, toh sach bolo, kya tumhe Himalayas se pyaar ho gaya hai? (Okay, tell me the truth, have you fallen in love with the Himalayas?)

Amit: Nahi, Riya. Main toh sirf tumse pyaar karta hoon. (No, Riya. I only love you.)

Riya: Amit, tum bhi na! Aise romantic ho gaye ho. (Amit, you're so romantic.)

Amit: Riya, sach mein, abhi toh sirf ek trek hua hai, lekin main chahta hoon ki hamari saath ki yeh yatra, hamesha chalti rahe. (Riya, seriously, we have only been on one trek, but I want our journey together to last forever.)

Riya: Amit, main bhi tumse bahut pyaar karti hoon. Agar tum promise karo ki hamesha mere saath rahoge, toh main tumhare saath yeh safar puri zindagi bhar karna chahti hoon. (Amit, I love you too. If you promise to always be by my side, then I want to go on this journey with you for the rest of my life.)

Amit: Riya, main hamesha tumhare saath rahunga. Tumhari har saans mein, har kadam mein, har safar mein. (Riya, I will always be with you. In every breath of yours, every step you take, in every journey.)

Riya: Amit, I love you. (Amit, I love you.)

[They embrace in a romantic moment and their love story blossoms amidst the beauty of the Himalayas.]
