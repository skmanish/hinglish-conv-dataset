Rahul: Hi, Kavita! Long time no see! Kahan thi tu? (Where were you?)

Kavita: Hey Rahul! Haan, thodi busy thi, but abhi wapas aa gayi. Tum batao, kaise ho? (Yeah, I was a little busy, but now I'm back. How are you?)

Rahul: I am good! Acha sun, main London gaya tha and wahan pata nahi kya hua, main coffee manga par unhone mujhe cup nahi diya, seedha saath table pe band kar diya. (I am good! Listen, I went to London and there, I don't know what happened, I asked for coffee but they didn't give me a cup, they just closed it with a lid on the table.)

Kavita: Kya? Wah! They thought you must be a spillage king, maybe too clumsy. Haha! (What? Wow! They thought you must be a spillage king, maybe too clumsy. Haha!)

Rahul: Haan yaar, mujhe samajh nahi aaya ki unhe bhi maloom ho gaya tha. I was so embarrassed. (Yeah, I didn't understand how they also figured it out. I was so embarrassed.)

Kavita: Oh my god! You must have felt so awkward. But don't worry, yahan par bhi itna kuch hota hai, culture shock ka toh kuch aur hi level hai. (Oh my god! You must have felt so awkward. But don't worry, even here, so much happens, culture shock is on a whole another level.)

Rahul: Sach? Koi incident batao na, mujhe bhi sunna hai kya hota hai tujhe yahan par. (Really? Tell me an incident, I also want to know what happens to you here.)

Kavita: Hmmm, ek baar maine ek foreigner ko saree pehenne ki koshish kari thi. Unko itna funny lag raha tha. Pehle toh woh confuse ho gaya fir humne usko bindi bhi pehnayi. Haha! (Hmm, once I tried to make a foreigner wear a saree. He found it so funny. First, he got confused, then we made him wear a bindi too. Haha!)

Rahul: Haha! Kamaal hai yaar. Theek hai, next time koi bhi cultural shock ho toh mujhe bula lena, main tujhe assist kar dunga. (Haha! That's amazing, buddy. Alright, the next time you have any cultural shock, just call me, I'll assist you.)

Kavita: Pakka, teri madad ka vaada hai. Tum itne cute ho, mujhe toh lagta hai tu yahan ke culture mein blend ho jayega. (Sure, I promise your assistance. You are so cute, I feel you'll blend into the culture here.)

Rahul: Thanks, babe! Tum vaha ki Miss India nikloge, the most beautiful girl in London. (Thanks, babe! You'll become Miss India there, the most beautiful girl in London.)

Kavita: Awww, you sweet talker! Tu bhi kam nahi, Mr. Handsome India. By the way, tu kab tak London mein tha? (Awww, you sweet talker! You are no less, Mr. Handsome India. By the way, how long were you in London?)

Rahul: Bas do hafte, par ab mujhe wapas India ki yaad aa rahi hai. Especially tumhari yaad. (Just two weeks, but now I'm missing India. Especially missing you.)

Kavita: Accha lag raha hai tujhe? I guess long-distance relationships work somehow. (You're enjoying it, huh? I guess long-distance relationships work somehow.)

Rahul: Hmm, shayad haan. But nothing can beat being with you, Kavita. Can't wait to be with you again. (Hmm, maybe yes. But nothing can beat being with you, Kavita. Can't wait to be with you again.)

Kavita: Rahul, I can't wait either. Yahan bhi aur wahan bhi humari romance ka silsila jaari rahega. (Rahul, I can't wait either. Our romance will continue here and there too.)

Rahul: Dekhte hain time kaise manage karte hain hum. I love you, Kavita. (Let's see how we manage our time. I love you, Kavita.)

Kavita: I love you too, Rahul. Abhi tu wapas aa ja, tujhse milne ka bada mann kar raha hai. (I love you too, Rahul. Now just come back, I really want to meet you.)

Rahul: Jaldi hi aa raha hoon, babe. Hamesha ke liye tumse milne. (I'm coming back soon, babe. To meet you forever.)
