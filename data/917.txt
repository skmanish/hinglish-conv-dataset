Nikhil: Hey Simran, tum yaad kar rahi ho woh beach holiday humare saath?

Simran: Haan, Nikhil! Woh sab kuch mere dil mein hai abhi bhi. Goa, theek hai na?

Nikhil: Haan, Goa it was! Woh pristine beaches aur mesmerizing sunsets, yaad hai?

Simran: Bilkul yaad hai! Aur woh humari beach walks, where we left our footprints side by side!

Nikhil: Haan, woh moments I will always cherish. Aur remember that beach shack, where we enjoyed delicious seafood?

Simran: Oh yes, those mouth-watering prawns and fish! Woh taste abhi tak mujhe yaad hai.

Nikhil: Aur woh sea kayaking! Tum saath thi, isliye I paddled with extra energy!

Simran: Haan, I remember! Woh waves humein bahut challenges diye, par we conquered them together.

Nikhil: Tumhari laughter, woh waves se bhi loud tha. It was music to my ears.

Simran: Achcha, woh dolphin spotting! The way those dolphins jumped in the sea, it felt so magical!

Nikhil: Haan, woh dolphins humari love story mein bhi witness the. They must have brought us good luck!

Simran: Hey, remember that time when we collected seashells on the beach? Woh hamare pyaare se memory hai!

Nikhil: Aur tumne mujhe woh special seashell diya tha, saying it will always remind me of you.

Simran: Haan, because you hold a special place in my heart, Nikhil.

Nikhil: Tum bhi mere dil mein special ho, Simran. Yeh holiday ne hamare dil ko bahut karib le aaya hai.

Simran: I couldn't agree more, Nikhil. Woh moments humesha yaad rahenge, forever etched in our hearts.

Nikhil: Simran, you know what? Tumhare saath yeh beach holiday was the most beautiful experience of my life.

Simran: Same here, Nikhil. Tumhare saath woh moments spent on the beach were like a dream come true.

Nikhil: Simran, yeh holiday humare pyaar ka ek naya chapter tha. Aur ab, iss chapter ko main aur khaas banana chahta hu.

Simran: Nikhil, tumhare saath yeh magical holiday mere liye bhi ek naya shuruwat tha. Aur ab hum dono milkar iss magical shuruwat ko apne pyaar ki kahani banayenge.

Nikhil: Simran, kya tum mujhse pyaar karti ho?

Simran: Haan, Nikhil, main tumse pyaar karti hu.

Nikhil: Simran, tum meri life ki waves ho, jo mere saath hamesha chalti rehti hai. I want to hold your hand and walk on the beach of life forever.
