Rohit: Hi there! Kya baat hai? You lookin' lovely today, Riya.
Riya: Hey, thank you! Tum bhi kam nahi lag rahe ho, Rohit. So, what's up?
Rohit: Bas, soch raha tha ki hum ek pet adopt kare. You know, like a cute little dog or a cat.
Riya: Wow, that sounds exciting! Mujhe bhi animals bahut pasand hai. I always wanted a pet. But Sahi palang kam hai, aur paalne ki responsibility bhi hai.
Rohit: Haan, I understand. Par imagine karo, we'll have a furry friend who'll always be there for us, bringing happiness in our lives.
Riya: True, paalne se hamari life colorful ho jayegi. Par apna time and care bhi dena hoga. Achhe se samjhe hai?
Rohit: Absolutely! We'll shower our love and take care of the little one. Aur ek baat batao, dog or cat? Tumhe kya pasand hai?
Riya: Honestly, I love both. Par I feel dogs are more loving and loyal, like true companions. Tumhe kya lagta hai?
Rohit: Mujhe bhi dogs zyada pasand hai. They're like our best friends, hamesha khush rehte hai. I can already imagine us taking our dog for long walks in the park.
Riya: Haan, that sounds wonderful! Sahi plan hai. Par tumhe koi specific breed pasand hai?
Rohit: Hmm, pata nahi. Maybe a Labrador retriever? They are playful and great with children. Tumhe kaisa lag raha hai?
Riya: Labrador toh bilkul cute hote hai. But you know what, mujhe pugs bhi bahut pasand hai. They're so adorable and always look happy.
Rohit: Pugs! Haan, woh toh super cute hote hai. Kuch na kuch silly antics karte rehte hai. Hamare ghar pe mazaa aa jayega.
Riya: Absolutely! Fir hum dono khud bhi khush rahenge. Aur agar kuch emotional ho jaaye, we'll have our pet to cheer us up.
Rohit: True, pets have this amazing ability to make us feel better. I can't wait to see a happy little pup running around in our house.
Riya: Me neither, Rohit. It's gonna be a beautiful journey, building our own little family. I'm already falling in love with this idea.
Rohit: Riya, mujhe bhi. Tumhare saath har pal bitana, aur hamari pet ki khushi ke saath apni zindagi rangeen karna, it'd be everything.
Riya: Rohit, you're so sweet. Tumhare saath har din aur har pal, I'm falling for you too. You make everything seem so magical.
Rohit: Riya, tum mere liye khaas ho. Seeing you smile, being with you, it's all I want. Tum mere dil ki rani ho.
Riya: Rohit, you've won my heart. Tum ho mere dil ke raja. Let's start this delightful journey together and create our own fairytale.
Rohit: Riya, I can't wait to fulfill all your dreams, make you the happiest person. I love you more than words can express.
Riya: I love you too, Rohit. You've brought happiness into my life already. Together, with our pet, we'll create a love story that'll last forever.
