Gaurav: Hey Priya, Delhi traffic is getting crazier by the day, isn't it?

Priya: Oh, Gaurav baba, tell me about it! It takes forever to get anywhere these days.

Gaurav: I know, right? I was stuck on the road for hours today. Bas kudiye, I wish I could teleport myself to avoid all this madness.

Priya: Haaye, Gaurav baba, if only teleportation was a thing here! We would never have to worry about this traffic again.

Gaurav: Tum toh hamesha intelligent ideas deti ho, Priya. Maybe we should invent our own teleportation device and become famous.

Priya: Haha, Gaurav, that would be amazing! We could revolutionize travel in Delhi and have our own little romantic adventures.

Gaurav: Romantic adventures, huh? That sounds interesting. I must say, Priya, you're full of surprises.

Priya: Oh, Gaurav baba, you're quite a charmer yourself. Always finding a way to make me smile.

Gaurav: Well, what can I say? Seeing your beautiful smile is worth all the traffic frustrations in the world.

Priya: Wow, Gaurav, that's quite a compliment. You really know how to make a girl feel special.

Gaurav: Priya, you deserve all the compliments in the world. You brighten up even the darkest of traffic jams.

Priya: Gaurav, you have a way with words. It's no wonder I enjoy talking to you so much.

Gaurav: And I enjoy every moment spent talking to you, Priya. You make the traffic seem less irritating.
