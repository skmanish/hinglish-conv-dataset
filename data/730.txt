Rohan: Hey Priya! Kaise ho? 
Priya: Hey Rohan! Main bilkul theek hu, aap batao? 
Rohan: Main bhi mast hu. So, I was thinking about something interesting - western culture and its impact on Indian youth. Kya tumne observe kiya hai is baare mein? 
Priya: Haan, mujhe bhi lagta hai ki western culture bhaut influence karta hai humari youth par. Alcohol consumption aur fashion trends jaise cheezo mein bhi western culture ka asar dikhta hai. What do you think? 
Rohan: Absolutely! The way dressing sense has changed, humari youth ki vyavaharikta bhi badal gayi hai. Earlier, humari traditional dresses itni popular nahi thi, but now, western clothes have become a major trend. 
Priya: True! Par kuch log western clothes pehanne se traditional culture ko bhool jaate hai. We should always respect our culture and balance it with western influence. What's your take on this? 
Rohan: Absolutely, Priya! Balance is the key. Humare traditional values aur sanskaro ko humesha yaad rakhna chahiye, but we can also appreciate and learn from the good aspects of western culture. 
Priya: You're right, Rohan. Western culture ne hume bahut kuch sikhaaya hai, like equal rights and gender equality. But at the same time, we shouldn't forget our own heritage. 
Rohan: Totally agree, Priya. We should embrace the positive changes while preserving our roots. Aisa na ho ki hum western culture mein itne kho jaaye ki humare apne sanskaar bhool jaaye! 
Priya: Exactly! We should be proud of our traditions and values. Waise, I really like the way you think, Rohan. You understand the importance of striking a balance. 
Rohan: Thanks, Priya! Tum bhi bahut samajhdaar ho. It's refreshing to have this conversation with you. 
Priya: The feeling is mutual, Rohan. Tumhe baat karne mein bahut mazaa aata hai. 
Rohan: Sach? Mera bhi toh wahi feeling hai, Priya. Aaj tak itna interesting conversation kisi ke saath nahi hua hai. 
Priya: Haha, aap mujhe itna bhaav mat khao! Lekin haan, mujhe bhi bahut accha laga aapke saath baat karke. 
Rohan: So, Priya, if you don't mind me asking, kya tumhare paas koi special favorite western culture influence hai? 
Priya: Hmm, mujhe western music aur movies bahut pasand hai. They have such a universal appeal. What about you, Rohan? 
Rohan: I love western music and fashion. They bring a certain energy and style that's hard to resist. 
Priya: Interesting! So, would you introduce me to some of your favorite western songs someday? 
Rohan: Of course, Priya! I would be more than happy to share my favorite playlist with you. And maybe we can dance to them together sometime! 
Priya: That sounds like a plan, Rohan! I would love to dance with you. 
Rohan: Great! Looking forward to it, Priya. By the way, you look beautiful today. 
Priya: Thank you, Rohan. You're quite charming yourself. 
Rohan: So, Priya, ek baat bolu? 
Priya: Haan, bolo na? 
Rohan: Tumse milkar mujhe bahut achha laga. Aur main soch raha hu ki... kya hum ek dusre ko better jaan sakte hai? Maybe we can go out for a coffee? 
Priya: Rohan, mujhe bhi tumse mil kar bahut achha laga. I would love to go out for a coffee with you! 
Rohan: That's great to hear, Priya! Chalo, phir kal shaam ko milte hai. 
Priya: Kal shaam ko milenge. Can't wait, Rohan!
