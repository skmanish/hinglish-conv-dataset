Rahul: Hey Riya! How are you doing today? 
Riya: Hey Rahul! I'm good, how about you? I just finished reading a book by Chetan Bhagat. Have you read any of his works? 
Rahul: Oh yeah, Chetan Bhagat is definitely one of my favorite authors too! I've read almost all of his books. Which one did you finish? 
Riya: I just finished "2 States." It was such a great story, I couldn't put it down! Have you read that one? 
Rahul: Absolutely! "2 States" is a fantastic book. I loved the way Chetan Bhagat portrayed the cultural differences and the challenges faced by the couple. It was so relatable! 
Riya: I agree, Rahul. The way he combines humor and romance is just perfect. We need more authors like him who write such engaging stories. 
Rahul: Definitely, Riya. By the way, have you read any other Indian authors apart from Chetan Bhagat? 
Riya: Yes, I have. I recently discovered Arundhati Roy. Her book "The God of Small Things" left me in awe. The way she weaves words together is just breathtaking. 
Rahul: Oh, I've heard about that book. It's on my reading list. I enjoy reading books that make you feel emotions deeply. 
Riya: You should definitely read it, Rahul. It will leave you captivated from start to finish. What other Indian authors do you recommend? 
Rahul: Well, apart from Chetan Bhagat, I would highly recommend Jhumpa Lahiri. Her book "Interpreter of Maladies" won the Pulitzer Prize and consists of beautiful short stories. 
Riya: Oh, I've heard about Jhumpa Lahiri, but I haven't read any of her works yet. I'll definitely add her to my reading list. Thanks for recommending. 
Rahul: You're welcome, Riya. I think you'll really enjoy her writing style. Her characters are so relatable and the stories are thought-provoking. 
Riya: I love books that make you think and stay with you long after you've finished reading them. That's the mark of a great author, isn't it? 
Rahul: Absolutely, Riya. It's amazing how books have the power to touch our lives and evoke different emotions. Talking about books with you is so interesting. 
Riya: I feel the same way, Rahul. It's refreshing to have someone to discuss literature with. Most of my friends aren't into reading as much as I am. 
Rahul: Well, I feel lucky to have met you, Riya. We have so much in common, including our love for reading. 
Riya: Me too, Rahul. It's not often that you find someone who shares similar interests and passions. It's really nice getting to know you better. 
Rahul: Riya, I've been wanting to tell you something for a while now. I think you're a remarkable person and spending time with you makes me incredibly happy. 
Riya: Rahul, I feel the exact same way. You're such a kind-hearted and witty person. Being with you feels so natural and comfortable. 
Rahul: You know, Riya, I've been thinking... would you like to go out on a date with me? I would love to take you to a bookstore and explore more Indian authors together. 
Riya: Rahul, I'd love to go on a date with you! Exploring a bookstore and sharing our love for books sounds like a perfect date to me. 
Rahul: That's fantastic, Riya! I can't wait for our date. I promise it will be a memorable one. 
Riya: I'm really looking forward to it, Rahul. This could be the beginning of a beautiful chapter in our lives.
