Raj: Hi Priya! Aaj toh tum traditional outfit mein bahut pretty lag rahi ho.
Priya: Thank you, Raj! Main traditional wear ke fan hoon. Tum western wear ke bare mein kya sochte ho?

Raj: Western wear bhi acche lagte hai, especially on special occasions like parties. Lekin mere liye traditional wear has a charm of its own. Wo Indian culture aur traditions ko bhi reflect karte hai.

Priya: Haan, it's true. India ka rich culture traditional outfits mein hi aur zyada nikhar aata hai. Lekin western wear mein hum log comfortable feel karte hai.

Raj: Haan, comfort jaruri hai, lekin traditional wear pehente time mujhe ek different confidence feel hoti hai. Waise, tum western wear mein bhi bahut stylish lagti ho.

Priya: Thanks, Raj! I believe western wear gives us a sense of freedom and experimentation. Traditional outfits toh mostly fixed patterns mein aate hai.

Raj: Lekin isme hi toh baat hai, Priya! Is fixed pattern mein hi hamare outfits ka apna ek unique style hai. Like saree, it can be draped in so many different ways and each style has its own beauty.

Priya: Haan, saree toh timeless beauty hai. Lekin western outfits ke accessories and cuts bhi modern aur stylish look dete hai. We can mix and match different pieces effortlessly.

Raj: You have a point there, Priya. But for me, the elegance and grace of traditional wear can't be matched. Like when you wear Indian ethnic dresses, it brings out your natural beauty even more.

Priya: Raj, you always know how to compliment! Tum bhi traditional wear mein handsome lagte ho.

Raj: Thank you, Priya! Waise tumhe kabhi traditional outfit mein dekha hai? Agar, han toh mujhe zaroor batana.

Priya: Haha, abhi tak nahi. Lekin agar kabhi mere friends ki shaadi ho toh jaroor pehenungi. Aur phir tumse zaroor share karungi ki kaisa lag rahi hu.

Raj: That would be amazing, Priya! Main aapni saari dates cancel karke, waha zaroor aaunga. Aur tab main bhi koi traditional outfit pehenunga.

Priya: Oh really! Mujhe lagta tha tum sirf western wear ke fan ho. Lekin I would love to see you in traditional attire.

Raj: Haan, I enjoy both styles, Priya. Special occasions par toh traditional wear rocks! Aur agar tum ho mere saath, toh kya kehna.

Priya: Awww, Raj! Tum bhi na, always sweet and charming. But you know, shadi mein toh ladkiyon ke outfits pe zyada focus hota hai.

Raj: That's true, lekin mere pyaare friends ki shaadi hai toh I'll definitely take the chance to impress you with my traditional look.

Priya: Chalo, I'm looking forward to it! Tumhara traditional look dekhne ke liye toh aur bhi excited ho rahi hu.

Raj: I'm glad to hear that, Priya! Waise, yeh discussion karke mujhe bada hunger lag raha hai. Kuch khane chalein?

Priya: Haha, tumhe toh hamesha bhook lagti hai. Chalo, I know this amazing place where we can have delicious street food. Let's go?

Raj: Perfect! Aapki choice humesha amazing hoti hai. Chalo, phir kisiko traditional wear pehenaake, street food try karte hai.
