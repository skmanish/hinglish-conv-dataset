Rohan: Hey, Kavya! Weekends are finally here. Any plans?

Kavya: Hi, Rohan! I was thinking about going for a long drive. How about you?

Rohan: That sounds great! How about we go to Lonavala? The weather there is just perfect.

Kavya: Lonavala sounds amazing! By the way, who's coming along with us?

Rohan: It would be amazing if it's just the two of us. What do you say, Kavya?

Kavya: Hmm, sounds interesting! Just the two of us, huh? Are you trying to impress me, Rohan?

Rohan: Well, I wouldn't deny that, Kavya! I can't resist an opportunity to spend quality time with you.

Kavya: You're such a charmer, Rohan! So, when should we leave for Lonavala?

Rohan: How about we leave tomorrow morning? We can have a leisurely drive and enjoy the scenery on the way.

Kavya: That works for me. I can't wait to breathe in the fresh air and have a peaceful time.

Rohan: Trust me, Kavya, it's going to be an unforgettable weekend with you by my side.

Kavya: Aww, you know how to make me blush, Rohan! I'm really excited about this trip now.

Rohan: I'm glad you're excited. I promise to make this trip worth remembering. So, any specific places you want to visit in Lonavala?

Kavya: I've always wanted to explore the Kune waterfalls. I've heard they are breathtakingly beautiful.

Rohan: Perfect! We can start with the Kune waterfalls. I'll make sure we take some amazing pictures together.

Kavya: Sounds like a plan! I'm looking forward to those insta-worthy pictures with you.

Rohan: It's going to be a weekend full of adventure, laughter, and creating memories together, Kavya.

Kavya: I couldn't agree more, Rohan. I feel lucky to have such an amazing person to spend my weekend with.

Rohan: The feeling is mutual, Kavya. I can't wait for tomorrow to come and for our amazing weekend to begin.

Kavya: Me neither, Rohan. Let's have the time of our lives and make this weekend the most special one.

Rohan: Absolutely, Kavya. I have a feeling that this weekend is just the beginning of something beautiful between us.

Kavya: Hmm, maybe it is, Rohan. Maybe it is.
