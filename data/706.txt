Rohan: Hey Simran, I heard you're a big fan of Indian classical dances. Is that true? 
Simran: Haan, Rohan! Main bilkul pagal hoon Indian classical dances ke liye. Especially, Kathak aur Bharatanatyam. The grace and beauty of these dance forms are unmatched. 
Rohan: Wow, that's amazing! I have always found these dance forms mesmerizing, especially the way they tell stories through their movements. 
Simran: Exactly! Just imagine the expressions and emotions that the dancers bring to life through their abhinaya. It's like they are communicating directly with the audience's soul. 
Rohan: Absolutely, Simran! And the intricate footwork in Kathak and the fluidity of movements in Bharatanatyam are so captivating. 
Simran: And let's not forget about the costumes and the jewelry. They add such a royal and elegant touch to the performances. It's like an ethereal experience to witness it all. 
Rohan: I couldn't agree more, Simran. It's like stepping into a different era altogether, where elegance and grace are the heart of everything. 
Simran: Tumhe pata hai Rohan, mujhe yeh dance forms perform karna bhi bahut pasand hai. 
Rohan: Sach? That's amazing, Simran! You must be an incredible dancer. 
Simran: Awww, thank you, Rohan! Tum bhi kabhi dekho mujhe perform karte hue. 
Rohan: Jarur dekhunga, Simran! I would love to see you dance. 
Simran: Rohan, kya tumne kabhi kisi classical dance performance ko live dekha hai? 
Rohan: Haan, Simran! Ek baar toh maine live Kathak performance dekhi thi. It was such an enchanting experience, as if time stood still. 
Simran: Wah! I'm sure woh performance bohot amazing hoga. Mujhe bhi live dekhna hai classical dance. 
Rohan: Definitely, Simran! We should plan to watch a live performance together. What do you say? 
Simran: That sounds like a wonderful idea, Rohan! I would love to watch it with you. 
Rohan: Great! Shyamak Maheshwari is performing Bharatanatyam next week. We can go together. 
Simran: Perfect, Rohan! I can't wait for next week then. It's going to be a memorable experience. 
Rohan: I'm looking forward to it too, Simran. And who knows, maybe we can have our own little dance afterward. 
Simran: Oh, really? You're quite the charmer, aren't you, Rohan? Maybe we can dance our way into each other's hearts. 
Rohan: That's the plan, Simran! Let's get ready to enjoy the performance and make our own sweet memories. 
Simran: I'm excited, Rohan. Can't wait for our dance-filled evening together. 
Rohan: Me too, Simran! It's going to be magical.
