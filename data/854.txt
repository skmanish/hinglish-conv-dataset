Aman: Hey, Naina! Kya bolti tu? (Hey, Naina! What's up?)

Naina: Sab theek, Aman! Tum batao, kaise ho? (Everything is fine, Aman! How about you?)

Aman: Bilkul mast! Tere saath baat karke aur bhi achha lag raha hai. (Absolutely fantastic! Talking to you feels even better.)

Naina: Aww, thank you, Aman! Tum bhi mere liye kuch special ho. By the way, tune kabhi India ke bhoot-pret ki kahaniyon ke baare mein suna hai? (Aww, thank you, Aman! You are special to me too. By the way, have you ever heard about the ghost stories from India?)

Aman: Haan, suna hai, Naina! Bharat ki har kona se anek aisi kahaniyan suni hain. Woh bhoot, chudail aur daayan ki kahaniyaan hamesha se mere dil ko dhadka deti hai. (Yes, I have heard, Naina! I have heard several such stories from every corner of India. Those ghost, witch, and vampire tales have always made my heart beat faster.)

Naina: Mujhe bhi un kahaniyon mein dilchaspi hai, Aman! Woh bhoot ki tarah saath chalte hai, Lekin kuch log unmein vishwas nahi karte. (I am interested in those stories too, Aman! They walk with us like ghosts, but some people don't believe in them.)

Aman: Haan, kuch logo ke liye woh sirf mann ka vichar hote hain. Woh bhi sochte hain ki ye kahaniyan humare dimaag ki duniya ki utpatti hain. (Yes, for some people, they are just thoughts of the mind. They also think that these stories are creations of our imagination.)

Naina: Par woh log bhool jate hain ki ye kahaniyan humare sanskriti aur itihaas ka important hissa hain. Woh bhoot-pret ki kahaniyaan humein hamare purvajon ka gyaan deti hain. (But those people forget that these stories are an important part of our culture and history. Those ghost stories give us knowledge about our ancestors.)

Aman: Absolutely! Woh folk tales, legends, aur myths humein hamari cultural legacy ke bare mein sikhati hain. Kuch kahaniyan toh itne romanchak hote hain ki dil ko cheer deti hain. (Absolutely! Those folk tales, legends, and myths teach us about our cultural legacy. Some stories are so thrilling that they make the heart race.)

Naina: Haan, aur bahut saari folk tales chudailon aur daayanon ke baare mein hoti hain. Unko sune bina toh bhooton ki kami mehsoos hoti hai. (Yes, and there are many folk tales about witches and vampires. Without hearing them, it feels like there's a shortage of ghosts.)

Aman: Sach mein, Naina! Toh sun! Maine ek kahani suni thi ek bhootni ki, jiske paas ek laal aankhein aur hothon par hamesha ek muskurahat hoti hai. (Really, Naina! So listen! I heard a story about a female ghost with red eyes and a perpetual smile on her lips.)

Naina: Woh kaisi kahani hai? Mujhe bhi sunao. (What kind of story is that? Tell me too.)

Aman: Suno, suno! Woh bhootni har raat ek peepal ke ped ke neeche aati hai aur wahan ke logon ko daraati hai. Uski muskurahat aur uske aankhon ka rang logo ko bhayabheet kar dete hain. (Listen, listen! That ghost comes under a peepal tree every night and scares the local people. Her smile and the color of her eyes terrify everyone.)

Naina: Kitni raazmakhosh kahani hai, Aman! Woh bhootni kitni rochak aur darawani lagti hai. (What a mysterious story, Aman! That female ghost sounds fascinating and scary.)

Aman: Haan, lekin bahut sundar lagti hai woh bhootni. Uski muskurahat dil ko chu leti hai aur uske saath sadma aur pyaar dono bharne lagte hain. (Yes, but that ghost is very beautiful. Her smile touches the heart, and being with her fills one with both shock and love.)

Naina: Aise bhootni se milne ka kya fayda? Darr toh hoga hi! (What's the use of meeting such a ghost? It will be scary!)

Aman: Par main toh soch raha tha ki tujhe usse milane ka mauka mil jaye. Tujhe woh darana pasand aayega ya nahi? (But I was thinking that if you get a chance to meet her. Will you like to be scared?)

Naina: Hmm, shayad. Mujhe toh aaj kal tumhari saath ka dar hi acha lagne laga hai. (Hmm, maybe. Lately, I've started liking the fear of being with you.)

Aman: Oh, really? Toh faisle ho gaye! Main toh bhootni ban gaya teri zindagi ka! (Oh, really? So the decision is made! I have become the ghost of your life!)

Naina: Haan, aur woh bhootni bhi ban gayi meri zindagi ka roshan sitara! (Yes, and that female ghost has become the bright star of my life too!)

[Aman and Naina share a laugh, leading to a romantic moment.]
