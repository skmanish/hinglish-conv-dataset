Rahul: Hey Simran, tujhe pata hai, maine ek naye biryani place ke baare mein suna hai Hyderabad mein. Mujhe yaad nahi aa raha hai naam, but I heard it's amazing!

Simran: Oh really? Biryani is my weakness, Rahul! Koi interesting information hai about this place?

Rahul: Haan, apparently waha ke biryani ke flavors bahut unique hai. They use some secret spices and techniques. I've heard it's a hidden gem!

Simran: That sounds intriguing! Lekin mujhe lagta hai Nizamabad ka biryani is the best in Hyderabad. Waha ke flavors and dum cooking, nothing can beat it.

Rahul: Are you serious, Simran? Main toh hamesha Ram ki bandi ke biryani ki fan hoon. Unka traditional way of cooking and authentic taste, dil jeet leta hai!

Rahul: Challenge accepted, Simran! Lekin next weekend, I will take you to Ram ki bandi and show you what true flavors are.

Simran: Alright, let's see who wins this biryani battle, Rahul! Par agar main jeet gayi toh, a treat from you is a must, haan?

Rahul: Deal, Simran! Lekin yaad rakhna, it won't be easy for you to beat my favorite biryani spot.

Simran: We'll see, Rahul. I'm ready for this delicious competition. It'll be fun exploring the best biryani places with you!
