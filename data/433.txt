Riya: Hey Rahul, tune finally driving shuru kiya ya abhi tak nahi?

Rahul: Hey Riya, haan maine abhi tak shuru nahi kiya hai. I'm a little nervous about learning to drive.

Riya: Arre, Rahul, don't worry yaar! It's not that difficult. You just need some practice and you'll get the hang of it.

Rahul: Yeah, but I've heard the traffic in our city can get crazy. It's so chaotic!

Riya: True, true, traffic can be a challenge. But once you learn to tackle it, driving becomes a breeze. Plus, it can be fun too!

Rahul: I hope so! I just hope I can manage all those crazy turns and roundabouts.

Riya: Oh come on, Rahul! You're an intelligent guy. I'm sure you'll handle it like a pro.

Rahul: Thanks, Riya. Your confidence in me means a lot. Maybe you can come along for my first drive, it'll be nice to have moral support.

Riya: Aw, that's sweet of you to ask, Rahul. I'd love to join you. We'll make it a fun experience!

Rahul: Great! And you know, if I'm being honest, one of the reasons I'm excited to learn driving is to spend more time with you.

Riya: Really, Rahul? That's so sweet of you to say. I'd love to spend more time with you too. And driving together sounds like a perfect opportunity.

Rahul: Yeah, it's like a little adventure we can embark on together. Exploring new places, singing along to our favorite songs, and just being in each other's company.

Riya: That sounds absolutely wonderful, Rahul. I can already imagine us with the wind in our hair, laughing and enjoying the ride.

Rahul: Riya, you have no idea how happy it makes me to hear that. I'm really looking forward to creating those special memories with you.

Riya: Rahul, I feel the same way. Let's make these learning sessions fun and memorable. I can't wait to see you behind the wheel!

Rahul: Riya, you are my motivation. With you by my side, I know I can conquer any driving challenge and get that driver's license.

Riya: Rahul, together we can conquer anything. I believe in you. And remember, I'll always be right there cheering you on every step of the way.

Rahul: Thank you, Riya. You're the best thing that's ever happened to me. Let's take on this new adventure together and create a beautiful love story.

Riya: I couldn't agree more, Rahul. Here's to our love story and many more exciting moments on the road ahead. I can't wait to fall in love with you all over again while you learn to drive.

Rahul: Riya, you're my everything. I'm so grateful to have you by my side. Let's make every moment count, both on the road and in our hearts. Te amo, Riya.

Riya: Te amo, Rahul. I'm head over heels in love with you. This journey of love and learning to drive just got a whole lot more exciting.
