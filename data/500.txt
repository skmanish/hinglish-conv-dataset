Rohan: Hey Riya! Yaar, remember when we went to the amusement park last month?

Riya: Oh yes, Rohan! It was such a fun day! I can't believe how many rides we went on!

Rohan: Haan yaar, that roller coaster ride was insane! I still remember how you screamed the entire time.

Riya: Excuse me, Mr. Braveheart! You were also screaming like a little child!

Rohan: Haha, okay fine! But I must say, the Ferris wheel was my favorite. The view from the top was just magical.

Riya: Absolutely! We got to see the entire city from up there. It was so romantic.

Rohan: You're right, Riya. It was the perfect setting for a romantic moment. By the way, do you remember that haunted house?

Riya: Oh my God! That haunted house was so spooky. I was clinging onto your arm the whole time!

Rohan: Don't worry, I was there to protect you. I'll always be there for you.

Riya: Aww, so sweet of you, Rohan. I feel lucky to have you as my friend.

Rohan: Friend? Riya, you know you mean more than just a friend to me, right?

Riya: (blushing) Really? What do you mean, Rohan?

Rohan: I mean, Riya, ever since that amusement park day, I've realized that my feelings for you go beyond friendship. I think I've fallen for you.

Riya: (smiling) Oh Rohan, I feel the same way too. I've been waiting for you to say this.

Rohan: (grinning) Really? So, does this mean we can be more than just friends now?

Riya: (nodding) Yes, Rohan. I would love to be more than friends with you.

Rohan: (taking her hand) Riya, you've made me the happiest guy on Earth today.

Riya: (blushing) And you've made me the luckiest girl, Rohan.

Rohan: (leaning in) May I steal a kiss from the luckiest girl in the world?

Riya: (closing her eyes) Yes, Rohan. The luckiest girl is all yours.

(They share a passionate kiss, sealing their new relationship at the very place where their journey began.)
