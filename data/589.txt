Rahul: Hey Simran, did you attend Raj's wedding last week?

Simran: Haan Rahul, mai to fatafat se pahunch gayi thi! It was such a grand affair!

Rahul: Oh wow! Kaisa tha? Tell me everything!

Simran: Well, Rahul, the venue was absolutely stunning! The decorations were so beautiful, and the whole place was lit up with fairy lights.

Rahul: That sounds mesmerizing! Aur shaadi me kya kya hua, batao na?

Simran: Raj looked like a prince in his sherwani! And Rani, I mean, Rajni, was a vision in her bridal lehenga. They made such a perfect couple!

Rahul: Aww, sounds like a fairytale wedding! Aur reception kaise tha?

Simran: Reception was full-on masti! There was so much dancing and singing. Even I couldn't resist shaking a leg on the dance floor!

Rahul: Oh, I can totally imagine you killing it on the dance floor, Simran! Tum to party queen ho!

Simran: Haha, thank you, Rahul! But you know, it was just the wedding vibes that got to me.

Rahul: Well, Simran, you're always full of energy and enthusiasm. I'm sure everyone had a great time with you around!

Simran: You're too sweet, Rahul! But tell me, what do you think about Raj and Rajni as a couple?

Rahul: Abhi tak toh just friends they were, but seeing them together at the wedding made me think, they have an amazing chemistry. They complement each other so well.

Simran: Hmm, true! Sometimes, friendships bloom into something more beautiful, right?

Rahul: Haan, Simran. It's like love finds its way unexpectedly. It's magical!

Simran: Absolutely! I guess shaadiyon mein kuch khaas hai jo dil ko chu jaata hai.

Rahul: You're right, Simran. Perhaps it's the celebration of love, togetherness, and new beginnings that warms our hearts.

Simran: Accha, Rahul, speaking of weddings, kya tum soch rahe ho kabhi apni shaadi ki?

Rahul: Hmm, well, I haven't really given it much thought. But if I find someone who brings as much happiness as Raj and Rajni have, then why not?

Simran: That's so sweet, Rahul! I hope you find that special someone soon.

Rahul: Thanks, Simran, I hope so too. By the way, tumko shaadi ki koi plan hai?

Simran: Abhi toh shaadi ki umar nahi hai, Rahul. But one day, when the time is right, I would love to settle down with someone who truly understands me.

Rahul: Whoever that person would be, I'm sure he'll be the luckiest guy in the world to have you, Simran.

Simran: Rahul, tum bhi na, always saying such nice things! You never fail to make me smile.

Rahul: Well, that's my secret mission - to keep that beautiful smile of yours intact, Simran.

Simran: Aww, Rahul, you're such a charmer! I'm really glad we had this conversation today.

Rahul: Me too, Simran. Talking to you always brightens up my day. You're special.

Simran: You're special too, Rahul. Kabhi milenge aur phir shaadi ki kahaaniyon ko aage badhaenge.

Rahul: Zaroor, Simran. Milte hai jald hi, aur phir saath mei woh pyaari si kahaani likhte hai jisme hum dono ke beech ka rishta ho.

Simran: Sounds like a plan, Rahul. Until then, take care and keep spreading your charm!

Rahul: You too, Simran. Dil se dhyan rakhna aur muskurahat kabhi na chhodna. Looking forward to the day we write our own love story.

Simran: Absolutely, Rahul. It will be a beautiful one. Goodbye for now, and see you soon!

Rahul: Goodbye, Simran. Miss you already. Until we meet again soon!
