Rohan: Hey Riya, check out my new music playlist! I've discovered some awesome indie Indian artists!

Riya: Oh, great! I would love to listen to some new music. What's the first song on your playlist?

Rohan: Yaar, it's called "Mere Saath" by Prateek Kuhad. The lyrics and melody are just perfect!

Riya: Oh, I've heard about Prateek Kuhad. His music is soulful! Let me add that song to my playlist as well.

Rohan: Awesome! You should also listen to "Kho Gaye Hum Kahan" by Jasleen Royal. It's a beautiful collaboration with Prateek Kuhad.

Riya: I've enjoyed Jasleen Royal's previous songs. This one must be amazing too. Can't wait to listen to it!

Rohan: I'm glad you're excited! By the way, have you heard "Mohabbat" by Krsna and Lisa Mishra? It's a groovy track and both artists sound amazing together.

Riya: No, I haven't heard that one yet. Thanks for recommending it, Rohan. I'll definitely give it a listen.

Rohan: You're welcome, Riya. Let me know how you like it. We can discuss the lyrics and the music later.

Riya: Sure, that sounds like a plan. Oh, and have you heard "Aafat Wapas" by Naezy? It's a rap song, but the lyrics are so meaningful.

Rohan: Yes, I've listened to it! Naezy's flow and the way he portrays emotions through his raps is truly impressive.

Riya: That's so cool! I never knew Indian rap could be so powerful. Thanks for sharing this track, Rohan.

Rohan: My pleasure, Riya. You know, I love how we can discover such amazing talent in our own country. There's so much more to explore!

Riya: Absolutely! We often get caught up in mainstream music, but there's a whole world of independent artists out there waiting to be discovered.

Rohan: And we can discover them together, Riya. Maybe we can go to a live indie music gig someday and explore this scene further.

Riya: That sounds like an amazing plan, Rohan. I'm always up for experiencing new music and moments together.

Rohan: Great, Riya! I can't wait for that day. Just imagine us getting lost in the rhythm of the music, dancing together, and enjoying each other's company.

Riya: It sounds magical, Rohan. I'm glad we share this love for music and exploration. You bring so much joy and excitement into my life.

Rohan: And you bring beauty and happiness into mine, Riya. Our shared passion for music is just one of the many reasons I feel a special connection with you.

Riya: That's so sweet, Rohan. I feel the same way. Our conversations, our laughter, and now our shared love for music... it all makes me fall for you even more.

Rohan: Riya, you make my heart skip a beat with your words. I'm so grateful to have you in my life. Let's keep exploring music and creating beautiful memories together.

Riya: I wouldn't want it any other way, Rohan. Let the melody of our love continue to grow, and may our playlist be filled with beautiful songs that remind us of each other.
