Rohan: Hey, Kavya! Tumne kuch der pehle mandir kyun jaaya tha? (Hey, Kavya! Why did you go to the temple a while ago?)

Kavya: Namaste, Rohan! Mujhe shraddha se roj mandir jaana acha lagta hai. Wahaan  sukoon aur shanti milti hai. (Hello, Rohan! I feel good going to the temple every day with devotion. It brings peace and tranquility.)

Rohan: Achha hai, lekin maine kabhi yeh nahi socha ki humare jeevan mein bhagwaan ka kya sthan hai. (That's nice, but I never thought about the role of God in our lives.)

Kavya: Bhagwan, humare jeevan ka ek important hissa hai. Woh humein guidance dete hai aur humari madad karte hai mushkilo mein. (God is an important part of our lives. They provide us with guidance and help us in difficult times.)

Rohan: Lekin kuch log toh khudko hi decide kartey hai, aur bhagwaan ko ismein involve nahi karte. (But some people decide for themselves and don't involve God in it.)

Kavya: Haan, lekin mujhe lagta hai ki bhagwaan ke vishwas se humare jeevan mein sukoon aur samriddhi aati hai. Woh humein sahi raasta dikhate hai. (Yes, but I believe that faith in God brings peace and prosperity to our lives. They show us the right path.)

Rohan: Shayad tum sahi ho, Kavya. Maybe I should also start exploring this spiritual side of life. Kya tum meri madad kar sakti ho? (Maybe you're right, Kavya. Can you help me with that?)

Kavya: Zaroor, Rohan! Main tumhe apne guru ke paas le jaaungi. Unke updesho se aapko bahut madad milegi. (Of course, Rohan! I will take you to my guru. His teachings will help you a lot.)

Rohan: Thank you, Kavya! Tumhare saath aisa kuch experience karna, mujhe bahut khushi hogi. (Thank you, Kavya! I would be really happy to have such an experience with you.)

Kavya: Mujhe bhi bahut khushi hogi, Rohan! Tumhare saath apni spiritual journey share karke aur tumhari madad karke. (I would be very happy too, Rohan! To share my spiritual journey with you and help you.)

Rohan: Humare jeevan mein aapki tarah positive aur blissful vibes hone se kuch special feel hota hai. (Having positive and blissful vibes like you in my life feels special.)

Kavya: Awww, Rohan! Tum bhi kam nahi ho, mere jeevan mein. Tumhari hansi aur dil se hote pyaar se mujhe sukoon milta hai. (Awww, Rohan! You're no less in my life. Your laughter and the love from your heart brings me peace.)

Rohan: Kavya, tumhare saath samay bitana mere liye ek anand hai. Tumne mujhe ek nayi disha dikhayi hai. (Kavya, spending time with you is a pleasure for me. You have shown me a new direction.)

Kavya: Rohan, hum dono ki yeh hinglish conversation na sirf spiritual journey ke baare mein hai, balki humare beech ek aur rishta ka uday ho raha hai. (Rohan, this Hinglish conversation of ours not only revolves around the spiritual journey but also signifies the birth of another relationship between us.)

Rohan: Tum saath ho toh har merely moment rom-com ka flavour le leta hai. (Whenever you're with me, every moment takes on the flavor of a romantic comedy.)

Kavya: Aaj ke baad, humari zindagi mein pyaar aur roshni ke haseen pal banenge, Rohan. (From today onwards, our life will be filled with beautiful moments of love and brightness, Rohan.)

[Rohan and Kavya hold hands and share a warm, affectionate gaze.]
