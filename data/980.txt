Rahul: Hey Pooja! Long time no see. Kaisi ho?

Pooja: Hey Rahul! Haan, theek hi hoon. Tum kaise ho?

Rahul: Main bhi theek hoon. You won't believe what I found today - a great shopping deal!

Pooja: Really? Tell me more!

Rahul: Yaar, there's this new store opened in the mall. They have a sale going on - up to 50% off on clothes!

Pooja: Wow, that sounds amazing! I love shopping, especially when there are good deals.

Rahul: I knew you would be interested. It's your shopping buddy duty to accompany me.

Pooja: Haha, for sure! We can go there this weekend. What else do they have on sale?

Rahul: Well, apart from clothes, they also have discounts on shoes, bags, and accessories.

Pooja: Oh, I need a new handbag! I hope they have some trendy options.

Rahul: Definitely! I saw some really stylish ones. You'll find something you like, for sure.

Pooja: That's great to hear. By the way, have you bought anything from there already?

Rahul: Not yet, I wanted to wait for you to go together. Let's make it a shopping date!

Pooja: Aww, that sounds fun! A shopping date it is then. We'll explore all the great deals together.

Rahul: Absolutely! And maybe we can grab a bite at our favorite cafe afterwards.

Pooja: That's a perfect plan. I must say, Rahul, you always come up with the best ideas.

Rahul: Only for you, Pooja. It's going to be a memorable day, just like our conversations.

Pooja: You always know how to make me smile, Rahul. I'm really looking forward to our shopping date.

Rahul: And I'm looking forward to spending time with you, Pooja. You make everything more special.

Pooja: That's so sweet of you to say, Rahul. I feel the same way about you.

Rahul: Pooja, can I tell you something? I've realized that I have feelings for you, more than just friendship.

Pooja: Rahul, I've been feeling the same way too. I'm glad you finally said it.

Rahul: Really? I can't believe it! This shopping trip is going to be even more memorable now.

Pooja: Yes, it will be. I can't wait to explore our feelings together, and maybe buy some amazing things too.

Rahul: Pooja, you and I, together, exploring the sales and exploring our hearts. It's going to be the best day ever.

Pooja: I couldn't agree more, Rahul. This shopping date is just the start of something beautiful between us.

[They both smile at each other, their eyes sparkling with anticipation.]
