Rohan: Hey Simran! Tumne woh new Bollywood movie dekhi hai?
(Simran: Hey Simran! Have you watched that new Bollywood movie?)

Simran: Haan, Rohan! Maine kal hi dekhi thi, bilkul zabardast thi. Tumne dekhi?
(Yes, Rohan! I watched it yesterday, it was absolutely fantastic. Did you watch it?)

Rohan: Nahi yaar, abhi tak time nahi mila. Kaisi lagi movie storyline?
(No, buddy, I haven't got the time yet. How was the movie's storyline?)

Simran: Ekdam mast storyline hai! Suspense, comedy, aur romance, sab hai. Poora paisa vasool hai!
(It has a fantastic storyline! There's suspense, comedy, and romance, everything. Totally worth the money!)

Rohan: Are, toh kya hai woh twist movie mein? Mujhe bata na!
(Hey, so what's that twist in the movie? Tell me!)

Simran: Are yaar, twist toh main kaise batau? Phir toh maza nahi rahega na dekhne ka?
(Hey, buddy, how can I tell you the twist? Then the fun of watching it wouldn't be there, right?)

Rohan: Achha, toh hum dono saath mein movie dekh lete hain. Tu mujhe sab bata degi during the interval. Deal?
(Alright, so let's watch the movie together. You can tell me everything during the break. Deal?)

Simran: Hmm, okay deal! Lekin ek shart hai, tu popcorn kharega?
(Hmm, okay deal! But there's one condition, will you buy popcorn?)

Rohan: Done! Popcorn toh pakka hai. By the way, movie ke songs kaisa tha?
(Done! Popcorn is a guarantee. By the way, how were the songs of the movie?)

Simran: Bilkul catchy the, especially romantic song. Kitna pyaara hai!

Rohan: Tu bhi na, jaise yeh romantic songs mujhe tumhare liye nahi lagte.
(You, always, as if these romantic songs don't seem to be for you.)

Simran: Oh really? Kiska liye lagte hain phir?
(Oh really? Then for whom do they seem to be?)

Rohan: Tumhare liye lagte hain, Simran.
(They seem to be for you, Simran.)

Simran: Achha, toh mujhe surprise karne ka plan tha. Tujhe kaise pata chal gaya?
(Oh really? I had a plan to surprise you. How did you find out about it?)

Rohan: Dil ki baat samajhne wale dost hote hain, aur main woh hoon.
(Friends who understand heart's feelings exist, and I am one of them.)

Simran: Wah, Mr. Romantic! Acha chal, movie dekhne chalein, mere personal popcorn buyer.
(Wow, Mr. Romantic! Okay, let's go watch the movie, my personal popcorn buyer.)

Rohan: Haan, chal Simran, popcorn ki dukaan tumhara personal popcorn buyer tere saath hai!
(Yes, let's go Simran, the popcorn stall is your personal popcorn buyer with you!)

[They both enter the cinema hall holding hands, excited to watch the movie together.]
