Riya: Absolutely! I loved how everyone was so welcoming and warm-hearted. Do you remember the delicious food we had there?

Nikhil: How can I forget, Riya! The authentic traditional dishes were so mouthwatering. Especially the hot, crispy jalebis and spicy puris.

Riya: Oh God, those jalebis were to die for! And that Rajasthani thali we had for lunch... I can still taste the flavors in my mouth.

Nikhil: Haan yaar, I still remember the tangy aamras and the lip-smacking dal baati churma. It was a feast for our taste buds.

Riya: Absolutely! And do you remember those colorful handicrafts we saw? The intricate embroidery and beautiful pottery?

Nikhil: Oh yes, Riya! The craftsmanship was incredible. I bought a hand-painted lampshade which still lights up my room.

Riya: That's wonderful, Nikhil! I remember the paintings on the walls and ceilings of the havelis, it felt like stepping into a different era.

Nikhil: True, Riya! The village was full of historical treasures. The stories behind those ancient forts and temples were captivating.

Nikhil: Riya, you're right. There is something special. Our bond is growing stronger with every memory we create. I don't want to lose you.

Riya: Nikhil, I don't want to lose you either. The way you make me feel is indescribable. I want to be with you, explore life together.

Nikhil: Riya, will you be my partner in this beautiful journey called life? Will you be my forever?

Riya: Nikhil, I've been waiting for you to ask. Yes, a thousand times yes! You're the one I want to share my life with.

Nikhil: Riya, you've filled my heart with joy. I promise to love you, respect you, and be with you through thick and thin. Forever and always.
