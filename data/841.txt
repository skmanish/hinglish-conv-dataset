Arjun: Hey Priya, kaisi hai? Long time no see!

Priya: Arjun! Mai theek hoon. Tum kahaan gayab the itne time se?

Arjun: Mai, actually humare pariwar ki mova ho gayi. New city, new school. Sab adjust karne mein thoda time laga.

Priya: Oh wow, that must have been tough. Which city did you move to?

Arjun: Hum Bangalore shift ho gaye. Yahan ka mausam bada acha hai!

Priya: Bangalore sounds amazing! Waise, how do you like your new school?

Arjun: Honestly, it took some time to adjust. But now, I've made new friends and the teachers are quite friendly.

Priya: That's great, Arjun! Making friends is so important, especially when you move to a new place. 

Arjun: Yeah, it was a bit nerve-wracking at first, lekin ab sab thik hai. By the way, how do you cope with new schools?

Priya: Well, I've moved schools a couple of times too. It can be challenging in the beginning, but I try to be open-minded and approachable.

Arjun: Tumhara approach mast hai, Priya. I'm sure you must have made so many friends wherever you go.

Priya: Haan, itni saari dostiyan bana chuki hoon. But it's always nice to meet new people and explore different cultures in a new city or school.

Arjun: You're absolutely right. It's quite an adventure to experience new things and meet different kinds of people.

Priya: Definitely, Arjun. It's all about embracing change and making the most of it. 

Arjun: Hmm, you have a really positive outlook, Priya. Koi secret hai?

Priya: Well, I believe that change is a part of life, so instead of resisting it, I try to adapt and learn from it.

Arjun: That's a wonderful outlook to have. By the way, you're looking gorgeous today, Priya.

Priya: Thank you, Arjun! Tum bhi kuch kam nahi lag rahe ho. 

Arjun: *blushes* Sach mein? Thanks, Priya. Tumhari smile mujhe hamesha khush kar deti hai.

Priya: Tum bhi itna sweet ho, Arjun. Aise compliments ka dil khush karke hi rahoge!

Arjun: Ab toh mujhe tumse aur zyada baat karne ka mann kar raha hai.

Priya: Waise hi pyaar bhari baatein karne ka mann kar raha hai, ya bas dosti?

Arjun: Dosti toh pehle se hai, lekin... I think there's something more than just friendship between us, Priya.

Priya: Arjun, mujhe bhi wahi lag raha hai. I feel a special connection with you.

Arjun: So, kya hum iss connection ko explore karne ke iraade se aage badh sakte hai?

Priya: Haan, Arjun. I think we should give it a try. Let's see where this connection takes us.

Arjun: That sounds amazing, Priya. I'm really glad we had this chat about adapting to new schools. It led us to this beautiful moment.

Priya: Me too, Arjun. Sometimes, unexpected conversations can bring forth the most beautiful surprises.

Arjun: Exactly, Priya. And I'm really excited to explore this new chapter with you, by my side.

(They both smile at each other, their hearts filled with warmth and anticipation for the future.)
